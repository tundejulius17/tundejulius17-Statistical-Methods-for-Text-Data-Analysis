       "[\"\\nDorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle\\nHenry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer's wife.\\nTheir house was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried\\nby wagon many miles. There were four walls, a floor and a roof,\\nwhich made one room; and this room contained a rusty looking cooking\\nstove, a cupboard for the dishes, a table, three or four chairs,\\nand the beds. Uncle Henry and Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner,\\nand Dorothy a little bed in another corner. There was no garret at\\nall, and no cellar--except a small hole, dug in the ground, called a\\ncyclone cellar, where the family could go in case one of those great\\nwhirlwinds arose, mighty enough to crush any building in its path. It\\nwas reached by a trap-door in the middle of the floor, from which a\\nladder led down into the small, dark hole.\",\n",
       " 'When Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see\\nnothing but the great gray prairie on every side. Not a tree nor a\\nhouse broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached the edge of\\nthe sky in all directions. The sun had baked the plowed land into a\\ngray mass, with little cracks running through it. Even the grass was\\nnot green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until\\nthey were the same gray color to be seen everywhere. Once the house had\\nbeen painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it\\naway, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else.',\n",
       " \"When Aunt Em came there to live she was a young, pretty wife. The\\nsun and wind had changed her, too. They had taken the sparkle from\\nher eyes and left them a sober gray; they had taken the red from her\\ncheeks and lips, and they were gray also. She was thin and gaunt,\\nand never smiled, now. When Dorothy, who was an orphan, first came\\nto her, Aunt Em had been so startled by the child's laughter that\\nshe would scream and press her hand upon her heart whenever Dorothy's\\nmerry voice reached her ears; and she still looked at the little girl\\nwith wonder that she could find anything to laugh at.\",\n",
       " 'Uncle Henry never laughed. He worked hard from morning till night and\\ndid not know what joy was. He was gray also, from his long beard to\\nhis rough boots, and he looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke.',\n",
       " 'It was Toto that made Dorothy laugh, and saved her from growing as\\ngray as her other surroundings. Toto was not gray; he was a little\\nblack dog, with long, silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled\\nmerrily on either side of his funny, wee nose. Toto played all day\\nlong, and Dorothy played with him, and loved him dearly.',\n",
       " 'To-day, however, they were not playing. Uncle Henry sat upon the\\ndoor-step and looked anxiously at the sky, which was even grayer than\\nusual. Dorothy stood in the door with Toto in her arms, and looked at\\nthe sky too. Aunt Em was washing the dishes.',\n",
       " 'From the far north they heard a low wail of the wind, and Uncle\\nHenry and Dorothy could see where the long grass bowed in waves\\nbefore the coming storm. There now came a sharp whistling in the\\nair from the south, and as they turned their eyes that way they saw\\nripples in the grass coming from that direction also.',\n",
       " 'Suddenly Uncle Henry stood up.',\n",
       " '\"There\\'s a cyclone coming, Em,\" he called to his wife; \"I\\'ll go look\\nafter the stock.\" Then he ran toward the sheds where the cows and\\nhorses were kept.',\n",
       " 'Aunt Em dropped her work and came to the door. One glance told her of\\nthe danger close at hand.',\n",
       " '\"Quick, Dorothy!\" she screamed; \"run for the cellar!\"',\n",
       " \"Toto jumped out of Dorothy's arms and hid under the bed, and the\\ngirl started to get him. Aunt Em, badly frightened, threw open the\\ntrap-door in the floor and climbed down the ladder into the small,\\ndark hole. Dorothy caught Toto at last, and started to follow her\\naunt. When she was half way across the room there came a great shriek\\nfrom the wind, and the house shook so hard that she lost her footing\\nand sat down suddenly upon the floor.\",\n",
       " 'A strange thing then happened.',\n",
       " 'The house whirled around two or three times and rose slowly through\\nthe air. Dorothy felt as if she were going up in a balloon.',\n",
       " 'The north and south winds met where the house stood, and made it the\\nexact center of the cyclone. In the middle of a cyclone the air is\\ngenerally still, but the great pressure of the wind on every side of\\nthe house raised it up higher and higher, until it was at the very\\ntop of the cyclone; and there it remained and was carried miles and\\nmiles away as easily as you could carry a feather.',\n",
       " 'It was very dark, and the wind howled horribly around her, but\\nDorothy found she was riding quite easily. After the first few whirls\\naround, and one other time when the house tipped badly, she felt as\\nif she were being rocked gently, like a baby in a cradle.',\n",
       " 'Toto did not like it. He ran about the room, now here, now there,\\nbarking loudly; but Dorothy sat quite still on the floor and waited\\nto see what would happen.',\n",
       " 'Once Toto got too near the open trap-door, and fell in; and at first\\nthe little girl thought she had lost him. But soon she saw one of his\\nears sticking up through the hole, for the strong pressure of the air\\nwas keeping him up so that he could not fall. She crept to the hole,\\ncaught Toto by the ear, and dragged him into the room again; afterward\\nclosing the trap-door so that no more accidents could happen.',\n",
       " 'Hour after hour passed away, and slowly Dorothy got over her fright;\\nbut she felt quite lonely, and the wind shrieked so loudly all about\\nher that she nearly became deaf. At first she had wondered if she\\nwould be dashed to pieces when the house fell again; but as the hours\\npassed and nothing terrible happened, she stopped worrying and\\nresolved to wait calmly and see what the future would bring. At last\\nshe crawled over the swaying floor to her bed, and lay down upon it;\\nand Toto followed and lay down beside her.',\n",
       " 'In spite of the swaying of the house and the wailing of the wind,\\nDorothy soon closed her eyes and fell fast asleep.',\n",
       " 'She was awakened by a shock, so sudden and severe that if Dorothy\\nhad not been lying on the soft bed she might have been hurt. As it\\nwas, the jar made her catch her breath and wonder what had happened;\\nand Toto put his cold little nose into her face and whined dismally.\\nDorothy sat up and noticed that the house was not moving; nor was it\\ndark, for the bright sunshine came in at the window, flooding the\\nlittle room. She sprang from her bed and with Toto at her heels ran\\nand opened the door.',\n",
       " 'The little girl gave a cry of amazement and looked about her, her\\neyes growing bigger and bigger at the wonderful sights she saw.',\n",
       " 'The cyclone had set the house down, very gently--for a cyclone--in\\nthe midst of a country of marvelous beauty. There were lovely patches\\nof green sward all about, with stately trees bearing rich and\\nluscious fruits. Banks of gorgeous flowers were on every hand, and\\nbirds with rare and brilliant plumage sang and fluttered in the trees\\nand bushes. A little way off was a small brook, rushing and sparkling\\nalong between green banks, and murmuring in a voice very grateful to\\na little girl who had lived so long on the dry, gray prairies.',\n",
       " 'While she stood looking eagerly at the strange and beautiful sights,\\nshe noticed coming toward her a group of the queerest people she had\\never seen. They were not as big as the grown folk she had always been\\nused to; but neither were they very small. In fact, they seemed about\\nas tall as Dorothy, who was a well-grown child for her age, although\\nthey were, so far as looks go, many years older.',\n",
       " \"Three were men and one a woman, and all were oddly dressed. They wore\\nround hats that rose to a small point a foot above their heads, with\\nlittle bells around the brims that tinkled sweetly as they moved. The\\nhats of the men were blue; the little woman's hat was white, and she\\nwore a white gown that hung in plaits from her shoulders; over it were\\nsprinkled little stars that glistened in the sun like diamonds. The men\\nwere dressed in blue, of the same shade as their hats, and wore well\\npolished boots with a deep roll of blue at the tops. The men, Dorothy\\nthought, were about as old as Uncle Henry, for two of them had beards.\\nBut the little woman was doubtless much older: her face was covered\\nwith wrinkles, her hair was nearly white, and she walked rather stiffly.\",\n",
       " 'When these people drew near the house where Dorothy was standing in\\nthe doorway, they paused and whispered among themselves, as if afraid\\nto come farther. But the little old woman walked up to Dorothy, made\\na low bow and said, in a sweet voice,',\n",
       " '\"You are welcome, most noble Sorceress, to the land of the Munchkins.\\nWe are so grateful to you for having killed the wicked Witch of the\\nEast, and for setting our people free from bondage.\"',\n",
       " 'Dorothy listened to this speech with wonder. What could the little\\nwoman possibly mean by calling her a sorceress, and saying she\\nhad killed the wicked Witch of the East? Dorothy was an innocent,\\nharmless little girl, who had been carried by a cyclone many miles\\nfrom home; and she had never killed anything in all her life.',\n",
       " 'But the little woman evidently expected her to answer; so Dorothy\\nsaid, with hesitation,',\n",
       " '\"You are very kind; but there must be some mistake. I have not killed\\nanything.\"',\n",
       " '\"Your house did, anyway,\" replied the little old woman, with a laugh;\\n\"and that is the same thing. See!\" she continued, pointing to the\\ncorner of the house; \"there are her two toes, still sticking out from\\nunder a block of wood.\"',\n",
       " 'Dorothy looked, and gave a little cry of fright. There, indeed, just\\nunder the corner of the great beam the house rested on, two feet were\\nsticking out, shod in silver shoes with pointed toes.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, dear! oh, dear!\" cried Dorothy, clasping her hands together in\\ndismay; \"the house must have fallen on her. What ever shall we do?\"',\n",
       " '\"There is nothing to be done,\" said the little woman, calmly.',\n",
       " '\"But who was she?\" asked Dorothy.',\n",
       " '\"She was the wicked Witch of the East, as I said,\" answered the\\nlittle woman. \"She has held all the Munchkins in bondage for many\\nyears, making them slave for her night and day. Now they are all set\\nfree, and are grateful to you for the favour.\"',\n",
       " '\"Who are the Munchkins?\" enquired Dorothy.',\n",
       " '\"They are the people who live in this land of the East, where the\\nwicked Witch ruled.\"',\n",
       " '\"Are you a Munchkin?\" asked Dorothy.',\n",
       " '\"No; but I am their friend, although I live in the land of the North.\\nWhen they saw the Witch of the East was dead the Munchkins sent a swift\\nmessenger to me, and I came at once. I am the Witch of the North.\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, gracious!\" cried Dorothy; \"are you a real witch?\"',\n",
       " '\"Yes, indeed;\" answered the little woman. \"But I am a good witch, and\\nthe people love me. I am not as powerful as the wicked Witch was who\\nruled here, or I should have set the people free myself.\"',\n",
       " '\"But I thought all witches were wicked,\" said the girl, who was half\\nfrightened at facing a real witch.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, no; that is a great mistake. There were only four witches in all\\nthe Land of Oz, and two of them, those who live in the North and the\\nSouth, are good witches. I know this is true, for I am one of them\\nmyself, and cannot be mistaken. Those who dwelt in the East and the\\nWest were, indeed, wicked witches; but now that you have killed one\\nof them, there is but one wicked Witch in all the Land of Oz--the one\\nwho lives in the West.\"',\n",
       " '\"But,\" said Dorothy, after a moment\\'s thought, \"Aunt Em has told me\\nthat the witches were all dead--years and years ago.\"',\n",
       " '\"Who is Aunt Em?\" inquired the little old woman.',\n",
       " '\"She is my aunt who lives in Kansas, where I came from.\"',\n",
       " 'The Witch of the North seemed to think for a time, with her head\\nbowed and her eyes upon the ground. Then she looked up and said,',\n",
       " '\"I do not know where Kansas is, for I have never heard that country\\nmentioned before. But tell me, is it a civilized country?\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, yes;\" replied Dorothy.',\n",
       " '\"Then that accounts for it. In the civilized countries I believe\\nthere are no witches left; nor wizards, nor sorceresses, nor\\nmagicians. But, you see, the Land of Oz has never been civilized, for\\nwe are cut off from all the rest of the world. Therefore we still\\nhave witches and wizards amongst us.\"',\n",
       " '\"Who are the Wizards?\" asked Dorothy.',\n",
       " '\"Oz himself is the Great Wizard,\" answered the Witch, sinking her\\nvoice to a whisper. \"He is more powerful than all the rest of us\\ntogether. He lives in the City of Emeralds.\"',\n",
       " 'Dorothy was going to ask another question, but just then the Munchkins,\\nwho had been standing silently by, gave a loud shout and pointed to the\\ncorner of the house where the Wicked Witch had been lying.',\n",
       " '\"What is it?\" asked the little old woman; and looked, and began\\nto laugh. The feet of the dead Witch had disappeared entirely and\\nnothing was left but the silver shoes.',\n",
       " '\"She was so old,\" explained the Witch of the North, \"that she dried\\nup quickly in the sun. That is the end of her. But the silver shoes\\nare yours, and you shall have them to wear.\" She reached down and\\npicked up the shoes, and after shaking the dust out of them handed\\nthem to Dorothy.',\n",
       " '\"The Witch of the East was proud of those silver shoes,\" said one of\\nthe Munchkins; \"and there is some charm connected with them; but what\\nit is we never knew.\"',\n",
       " 'Dorothy carried the shoes into the house and placed them on the\\ntable. Then she came out again to the Munchkins and said,',\n",
       " '\"I am anxious to get back to my Aunt and Uncle, for I am sure they\\nwill worry about me. Can you help me find my way?\"',\n",
       " 'The Munchkins and the Witch first looked at one another, and then at\\nDorothy, and then shook their heads.',\n",
       " '\"At the East, not far from here,\" said one, \"there is a great desert,\\nand none could live to cross it.\"',\n",
       " '\"It is the same at the South,\" said another, \"for I have been there\\nand seen it. The South is the country of the Quadlings.\"',\n",
       " '\"I am told,\" said the third man, \"that it is the same at the West. And\\nthat country, where the Winkies live, is ruled by the wicked Witch of\\nthe West, who would make you her slave if you passed her way.\"',\n",
       " '\"The North is my home,\" said the old lady, \"and at its edge is the\\nsame great desert that surrounds this land of Oz. I\\'m afraid, my\\ndear, you will have to live with us.\"',\n",
       " 'Dorothy began to sob, at this, for she felt lonely among all\\nthese strange people. Her tears seemed to grieve the kind-hearted\\nMunchkins, for they immediately took out their handkerchiefs and\\nbegan to weep also. As for the little old woman, she took off her\\ncap and balanced the point on the end of her nose, while she counted\\n\"one, two, three\" in a solemn voice. At once the cap changed to a\\nslate, on which was written in big, white chalk marks:',\n",
       " '\"LET DOROTHY GO TO THE CITY OF EMERALDS.\"',\n",
       " 'The little old woman took the slate from her nose, and, having read\\nthe words on it, asked,',\n",
       " '\"Is your name Dorothy, my dear?\"',\n",
       " '\"Yes,\" answered the child, looking up and drying her tears.',\n",
       " '\"Then you must go to the City of Emeralds. Perhaps Oz will help you.\"',\n",
       " '\"Where is this City?\" asked Dorothy.',\n",
       " '\"It is exactly in the center of the country, and is ruled by Oz, the\\nGreat Wizard I told you of.\"',\n",
       " '\"Is he a good man?\" enquired the girl, anxiously.',\n",
       " '\"He is a good Wizard. Whether he is a man or not I cannot tell, for I\\nhave never seen him.\"',\n",
       " '\"How can I get there?\" asked Dorothy.',\n",
       " '\"You must walk. It is a long journey, through a country that is\\nsometimes pleasant and sometimes dark and terrible. However, I will\\nuse all the magic arts I know of to keep you from harm.\"',\n",
       " '\"Won\\'t you go with me?\" pleaded the girl, who had begun to look upon\\nthe little old woman as her only friend.',\n",
       " '\"No, I cannot do that,\" she replied; \"but I will give you my kiss,\\nand no one will dare injure a person who has been kissed by the Witch\\nof the North.\"',\n",
       " 'She came close to Dorothy and kissed her gently on the forehead.\\nWhere her lips touched the girl they left a round, shining mark, as\\nDorothy found out soon after.',\n",
       " '\"The road to the City of Emeralds is paved with yellow brick,\" said the\\nWitch; \"so you cannot miss it. When you get to Oz do not be afraid of\\nhim, but tell your story and ask him to help you. Good-bye, my dear.\"',\n",
       " 'The three Munchkins bowed low to her and wished her a pleasant\\njourney, after which they walked away through the trees. The Witch\\ngave Dorothy a friendly little nod, whirled around on her left heel\\nthree times, and straightway disappeared, much to the surprise of\\nlittle Toto, who barked after her loudly enough when she had gone,\\nbecause he had been afraid even to growl while she stood by.',\n",
       " 'But Dorothy, knowing her to be a witch, had expected her to disappear\\nin just that way, and was not surprised in the least.',\n",
       " 'When Dorothy was left alone she began to feel hungry. So she went\\nto the cupboard and cut herself some bread, which she spread with\\nbutter. She gave some to Toto, and taking a pail from the shelf\\nshe carried it down to the little brook and filled it with clear,\\nsparkling water. Toto ran over to the trees and began to bark at the\\nbirds sitting there. Dorothy went to get him, and saw such delicious\\nfruit hanging from the branches that she gathered some of it, finding\\nit just what she wanted to help out her breakfast.',\n",
       " 'Then she went back to the house, and having helped herself and Toto\\nto a good drink of the cool, clear water, she set about making ready\\nfor the journey to the City of Emeralds.',\n",
       " 'Dorothy had only one other dress, but that happened to be clean and\\nwas hanging on a peg beside her bed. It was gingham, with checks\\nof white and blue; and although the blue was somewhat faded with\\nmany washings, it was still a pretty frock. The girl washed herself\\ncarefully, dressed herself in the clean gingham, and tied her pink\\nsunbonnet on her head. She took a little basket and filled it with\\nbread from the cupboard, laying a white cloth over the top. Then she\\nlooked down at her feet and noticed how old and worn her shoes were.',\n",
       " '\"They surely will never do for a long journey, Toto,\" she said. And\\nToto looked up into her face with his little black eyes and wagged\\nhis tail to show he knew what she meant.',\n",
       " 'At that moment Dorothy saw lying on the table the silver shoes that\\nhad belonged to the Witch of the East.',\n",
       " '\"I wonder if they will fit me,\" she said to Toto. \"They would be just\\nthe thing to take a long walk in, for they could not wear out.\"',\n",
       " 'She took off her old leather shoes and tried on the silver ones,\\nwhich fitted her as well as if they had been made for her.',\n",
       " 'Finally she picked up her basket.',\n",
       " '\"Come along, Toto,\" she said, \"we will go to the Emerald City and ask\\nthe great Oz how to get back to Kansas again.\"',\n",
       " 'She closed the door, locked it, and put the key carefully in the\\npocket of her dress. And so, with Toto trotting along soberly behind\\nher, she started on her journey.',\n",
       " 'There were several roads near by, but it did not take her long to\\nfind the one paved with yellow brick. Within a short time she was\\nwalking briskly toward the Emerald City, her silver shoes tinkling\\nmerrily on the hard, yellow roadbed. The sun shone bright and the\\nbirds sang sweet and Dorothy did not feel nearly as bad as you might\\nthink a little girl would who had been suddenly whisked away from her\\nown country and set down in the midst of a strange land.',\n",
       " 'She was surprised, as she walked along, to see how pretty the country\\nwas about her. There were neat fences at the sides of the road,\\npainted a dainty blue color, and beyond them were fields of grain and\\nvegetables in abundance. Evidently the Munchkins were good farmers\\nand able to raise large crops. Once in a while she would pass a\\nhouse, and the people came out to look at her and bow low as she\\nwent by; for everyone knew she had been the means of destroying the\\nwicked witch and setting them free from bondage. The houses of the\\nMunchkins were odd looking dwellings, for each was round, with a big\\ndome for a roof. All were painted blue, for in this country of the\\nEast blue was the favorite color.',\n",
       " 'Towards evening, when Dorothy was tired with her long walk and began\\nto wonder where she should pass the night, she came to a house rather\\nlarger than the rest. On the green lawn before it many men and women\\nwere dancing. Five little fiddlers played as loudly as possible and\\nthe people were laughing and singing, while a big table near by was\\nloaded with delicious fruits and nuts, pies and cakes, and many other\\ngood things to eat.',\n",
       " 'The people greeted Dorothy kindly, and invited her to supper and to\\npass the night with them; for this was the home of one of the richest\\nMunchkins in the land, and his friends were gathered with him to\\ncelebrate their freedom from the bondage of the wicked witch.',\n",
       " 'Dorothy ate a hearty supper and was waited upon by the rich Munchkin\\nhimself, whose name was Boq. Then she sat down upon a settee and\\nwatched the people dance.',\n",
       " 'When Boq saw her silver shoes he said,',\n",
       " '\"You must be a great sorceress.\"',\n",
       " '\"Why?\" asked the girl.',\n",
       " '\"Because you wear silver shoes and have killed the wicked witch.\\nBesides, you have white in your frock, and only witches and\\nsorceresses wear white.\"',\n",
       " '\"My dress is blue and white checked,\" said Dorothy, smoothing out the\\nwrinkles in it.',\n",
       " '\"It is kind of you to wear that,\" said Boq. \"Blue is the color of\\nthe Munchkins, and white is the witch color; so we know you are a\\nfriendly witch.\"',\n",
       " 'Dorothy did not know what to say to this, for all the people seemed\\nto think her a witch, and she knew very well she was only an ordinary\\nlittle girl who had come by the chance of a cyclone into a strange land.',\n",
       " 'When she had tired watching the dancing, Boq led her into the house,\\nwhere he gave her a room with a pretty bed in it. The sheets were\\nmade of blue cloth, and Dorothy slept soundly in them till morning,\\nwith Toto curled up on the blue rug beside her.',\n",
       " 'She ate a hearty breakfast, and watched a wee Munchkin baby, who\\nplayed with Toto and pulled his tail and crowed and laughed in a way\\nthat greatly amused Dorothy. Toto was a fine curiosity to all the\\npeople, for they had never seen a dog before.',\n",
       " '\"How far is it to the Emerald City?\" the girl asked.',\n",
       " '\"I do not know,\" answered Boq, gravely, \"for I have never been there.\\nIt is better for people to keep away from Oz, unless they have\\nbusiness with him. But it is a long way to the Emerald City, and it\\nwill take you many days. The country here is rich and pleasant, but\\nyou must pass through rough and dangerous places before you reach the\\nend of your journey.\"',\n",
       " 'This worried Dorothy a little, but she knew that only the great Oz\\ncould help her get to Kansas again, so she bravely resolved not to\\nturn back.',\n",
       " 'She bade her friends good-bye, and again started along the road of\\nyellow brick. When she had gone several miles she thought she would\\nstop to rest, and so climbed to the top of the fence beside the road\\nand sat down. There was a great cornfield beyond the fence, and not\\nfar away she saw a Scarecrow, placed high on a pole to keep the birds\\nfrom the ripe corn.',\n",
       " 'Dorothy leaned her chin upon her hand and gazed thoughtfully at the\\nScarecrow. Its head was a small sack stuffed with straw, with eyes,\\nnose and mouth painted on it to represent a face. An old, pointed\\nblue hat, that had belonged to some Munchkin, was perched on this\\nhead, and the rest of the figure was a blue suit of clothes, worn and\\nfaded, which had also been stuffed with straw. On the feet were some\\nold boots with blue tops, such as every man wore in this country, and\\nthe figure was raised above the stalks of corn by means of the pole\\nstuck up its back.',\n",
       " 'While Dorothy was looking earnestly into the queer, painted face of\\nthe Scarecrow, she was surprised to see one of the eyes slowly wink\\nat her. She thought she must have been mistaken, at first, for none of\\nthe scarecrows in Kansas ever wink; but presently the figure nodded its\\nhead to her in a friendly way. Then she climbed down from the fence and\\nwalked up to it, while Toto ran around the pole and barked.',\n",
       " '\"Good day,\" said the Scarecrow, in a rather husky voice.',\n",
       " '\"Did you speak?\" asked the girl, in wonder.',\n",
       " '\"Certainly,\" answered the Scarecrow; \"how do you do?\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m pretty well, thank you,\" replied Dorothy, politely; \"how do you\\ndo?\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m not feeling well,\" said the Scarecrow, with a smile, \"for it is\\nvery tedious being perched up here night and day to scare away crows.\"',\n",
       " '\"Can\\'t you get down?\" asked Dorothy.',\n",
       " '\"No, for this pole is stuck up my back. If you will please take away\\nthe pole I shall be greatly obliged to you.\"',\n",
       " 'Dorothy reached up both arms and lifted the figure off the pole; for,\\nbeing stuffed with straw, it was quite light.',\n",
       " '\"Thank you very much,\" said the Scarecrow, when he had been set down\\non the ground. \"I feel like a new man.\"',\n",
       " 'Dorothy was puzzled at this, for it sounded queer to hear a stuffed\\nman speak, and to see him bow and walk along beside her.',\n",
       " '\"Who are you?\" asked the Scarecrow, when he had stretched himself and\\nyawned, \"and where are you going?\"',\n",
       " '\"My name is Dorothy,\" said the girl, \"and I am going to the Emerald\\nCity, to ask the great Oz to send me back to Kansas.\"',\n",
       " '\"Where is the Emerald City?\" he enquired; \"and who is Oz?\"',\n",
       " '\"Why, don\\'t you know?\" she returned, in surprise.',\n",
       " '\"No, indeed; I don\\'t know anything. You see, I am stuffed, so I have\\nno brains at all,\" he answered, sadly.',\n",
       " '\"Oh,\" said Dorothy; \"I\\'m awfully sorry for you.\"',\n",
       " '\"Do you think,\" he asked, \"If I go to the Emerald City with you, that\\nthe great Oz would give me some brains?\"',\n",
       " '\"I cannot tell,\" she returned; \"but you may come with me, if you\\nlike. If Oz will not give you any brains you will be no worse off\\nthan you are now.\"',\n",
       " '\"That is true,\" said the Scarecrow. \"You see,\" he continued,\\nconfidentially, \"I don\\'t mind my legs and arms and body being stuffed,\\nbecause I cannot get hurt. If anyone treads on my toes or sticks a\\npin into me, it doesn\\'t matter, for I cant feel it. But I do not want\\npeople to call me a fool, and if my head stays stuffed with straw\\ninstead of with brains, as yours is, how am I ever to know anything?\"',\n",
       " '\"I understand how you feel,\" said the little girl, who was truly\\nsorry for him. \"If you will come with me I\\'ll ask Oz to do all he can\\nfor you.\"',\n",
       " '\"Thank you,\" he answered, gratefully.',\n",
       " 'They walked back to the road, Dorothy helped him over the fence, and\\nthey started along the path of yellow brick for the Emerald City.',\n",
       " 'Toto did not like this addition to the party, at first. He smelled\\naround the stuffed man as if he suspected there might be a nest of\\nrats in the straw, and he often growled in an unfriendly way at the\\nScarecrow.',\n",
       " '\"Don\\'t mind Toto,\" said Dorothy, to her new friend; \"he never bites.\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, I\\'m not afraid,\" replied the Scarecrow, \"he can\\'t hurt the\\nstraw. Do let me carry that basket for you. I shall not mind it,\\nfor I can\\'t get tired. I\\'ll tell you a secret,\" he continued, as he\\nwalked along; \"there is only one thing in the world I am afraid of.\"',\n",
       " '\"What is that?\" asked Dorothy; \"the Munchkin farmer who made you?\"',\n",
       " '\"No,\" answered the Scarecrow; \"it\\'s a lighted match.\"',\n",
       " 'After a few hours the road began to be rough, and the walking grew so\\ndifficult that the Scarecrow often stumbled over the yellow bricks,\\nwhich were here very uneven. Sometimes, indeed, they were broken or\\nmissing altogether, leaving holes that Toto jumped across and Dorothy\\nwalked around. As for the Scarecrow, having no brains he walked\\nstraight ahead, and so stepped into the holes and fell at full length\\non the hard bricks. It never hurt him, however, and Dorothy would\\npick him up and set him upon his feet again, while he joined her in\\nlaughing merrily at his own mishap.',\n",
       " 'The farms were not nearly so well cared for here as they were farther\\nback. There were fewer houses and fewer fruit trees, and the farther\\nthey went the more dismal and lonesome the country became.',\n",
       " 'At noon they sat down by the roadside, near a little brook, and\\nDorothy opened her basket and got out some bread. She offered a piece\\nto the Scarecrow, but he refused.',\n",
       " '\"I am never hungry,\" he said; \"and it is a lucky thing I am not. For\\nmy mouth is only painted, and if I should cut a hole in it so I could\\neat, the straw I am stuffed with would come out, and that would spoil\\nthe shape of my head.\"',\n",
       " 'Dorothy saw at once that this was true, so she only nodded and went\\non eating her bread.',\n",
       " '\"Tell me something about yourself, and the country you came from,\"\\nsaid the Scarecrow, when she had finished her dinner. So she told\\nhim all about Kansas, and how gray everything was there, and how\\nthe cyclone had carried her to this queer land of Oz. The Scarecrow\\nlistened carefully, and said,',\n",
       " '\"I cannot understand why you should wish to leave this beautiful\\ncountry and go back to the dry, gray place you call Kansas.\"',\n",
       " \"'I was only made yesterday,' said the Scarecrow.\",\n",
       " '\"That is because you have no brains,\" answered the girl. \"No matter\\nhow dreary and gray our homes are, we people of flesh and blood\\nwould rather live there than in any other country, be it ever so\\nbeautiful. There is no place like home.\"',\n",
       " 'The Scarecrow sighed.',\n",
       " '\"Of course I cannot understand it,\" he said. \"If your heads were\\nstuffed with straw, like mine, you would probably all live in the\\nbeautiful places, and then Kansas would have no people at all. It is\\nfortunate for Kansas that you have brains.\"',\n",
       " '\"Won\\'t you tell me a story, while we are resting?\" asked the child.',\n",
       " 'The Scarecrow looked at her reproachfully, and answered,',\n",
       " '\"My life has been so short that I really know nothing whatever. I was\\nonly made day before yesterday. What happened in the world before\\nthat time is all unknown to me. Luckily, when the farmer made my\\nhead, one of the first things he did was to paint my ears, so that I\\nheard what was going on. There was another Munchkin with him, and the\\nfirst thing I heard was the farmer saying,',\n",
       " '\"\\'How do you like those ears?\\'',\n",
       " '\"\\'They aren\\'t straight,\\' answered the other.',\n",
       " '\"\\'Never mind,\\' said the farmer; \\'they are ears just the same,\\' which\\nwas true enough.',\n",
       " '\"\\'Now I\\'ll make the eyes,\\' said the farmer. So he painted my right\\neye, and as soon as it was finished I found myself looking at him and\\nat everything around me with a great deal of curiosity, for this was\\nmy first glimpse of the world.',\n",
       " '\"\\'That\\'s a rather pretty eye,\\' remarked the Munchkin who was watching\\nthe farmer; \\'blue paint is just the color for eyes.\\'',\n",
       " '\"\\'I think I\\'ll make the other a little bigger,\\' said the farmer; and\\nwhen the second eye was done I could see much better than before.\\nThen he made my nose and my mouth; but I did not speak, because\\nat that time I didn\\'t know what a mouth was for. I had the fun of\\nwatching them make my body and my arms and legs; and when they\\nfastened on my head, at last, I felt very proud, for I thought I was\\njust as good a man as anyone.',\n",
       " '\"\\'This fellow will scare the crows fast enough,\\' said the farmer; \\'he\\nlooks just like a man.\\'',\n",
       " '\"\\'Why, he is a man,\\' said the other, and I quite agreed with him. The\\nfarmer carried me under his arm to the cornfield, and set me up on a\\ntall stick, where you found me. He and his friend soon after walked\\naway and left me alone.',\n",
       " '\"I did not like to be deserted this way; so I tried to walk after\\nthem, but my feet would not touch the ground, and I was forced to\\nstay on that pole. It was a lonely life to lead, for I had nothing to\\nthink of, having been made such a little while before. Many crows and\\nother birds flew into the cornfield, but as soon as they saw me they\\nflew away again, thinking I was a Munchkin; and this pleased me and\\nmade me feel that I was quite an important person. By and by an old\\ncrow flew near me, and after looking at me carefully he perched upon\\nmy shoulder and said,',\n",
       " '\"\\'I wonder if that farmer thought to fool me in this clumsy manner.\\nAny crow of sense could see that you are only stuffed with straw.\\'\\nThen he hopped down at my feet and ate all the corn he wanted. The\\nother birds, seeing he was not harmed by me, came to eat the corn\\ntoo, so in a short time there was a great flock of them about me.\"',\n",
       " '\"I felt sad at this, for it showed I was not such a good Scarecrow\\nafter all; but the old crow comforted me, saying: \\'If you only had\\nbrains in your head you would be as good a man as any of them, and a\\nbetter man than some of them. Brains are the only things worth having\\nin this world, no matter whether one is a crow or a man.\\'',\n",
       " '\"After the crows had gone I thought this over, and decided I would\\ntry hard to get some brains. By good luck, you came along and pulled\\nme off the stake, and from what you say I am sure the great Oz will\\ngive me brains as soon as we get to the Emerald City.\"',\n",
       " '\"I hope so,\" said Dorothy, earnestly, \"since you seem anxious to have\\nthem.\"',\n",

       " '\"Well,\" said the girl, \"let us go.\" And she handed the basket to the\\nScarecrow.',\n",
       " 'There were no fences at all by the road side now, and the land was\\nrough and untilled. Towards evening they came to a great forest,\\nwhere the trees grew so big and close together that their branches\\nmet over the road of yellow brick. It was almost dark under the\\ntrees, for the branches shut out the daylight; but the travellers did\\nnot stop, and went on into the forest.',\n",
       " '\"If this road goes in, it must come out,\" said the Scarecrow, \"and as\\nthe Emerald City is at the other end of the road, we must go wherever\\nit leads us.\"',\n",
       " '\"Anyone would know that,\" said Dorothy.',\n",
       " '\"Certainly; that is why I know it,\" returned the Scarecrow. \"If it\\nrequired brains to figure it out, I never should have said it.\"',\n",
       " 'After an hour or so the light faded away, and they found themselves\\nstumbling along in the darkness. Dorothy could not see at all,\\nbut Toto could, for some dogs see very well in the dark; and the\\nScarecrow declared he could see as well as by day. So she took hold\\nof his arm, and managed to get along fairly well.',\n",

       " 'So the Scarecrow led her through the trees until they reached the\\ncottage, and Dorothy entered and found a bed of dried leaves in one\\ncorner. She lay down at once, and with Toto beside her soon fell\\ninto a sound sleep. The Scarecrow, who was never tired, stood up in\\nanother corner and waited patiently until morning came.',\n",
       " 'When Dorothy awoke the sun was shining through the trees and Toto\\nhad long been out chasing birds and squirrels. She sat up and looked\\naround her. There was the Scarecrow, still standing patiently in his\\ncorner, waiting for her.',\n",
       " '\"We must go and search for water,\" she said to him.',\n",
       " '\"Why do you want water?\" he asked.',\n",
       " '\"To wash my face clean after the dust of the road, and to drink, so\\nthe dry bread will not stick in my throat.\"',\n",
       " '\"It must be inconvenient to be made of flesh,\" said the Scarecrow,\\nthoughtfully; \"for you must sleep, and eat and drink. However, you\\nhave brains, and it is worth a lot of bother to be able to think\\nproperly.\"',\n",
       " 'They left the cottage and walked through the trees until they found a\\nlittle spring of clear water, where Dorothy drank and bathed and ate\\nher breakfast. She saw there was not much bread left in the basket,\\nand the girl was thankful the Scarecrow did not have to eat anything,\\nfor there was scarcely enough for herself and Toto for the day.',\n",
       " 'When she had finished her meal, and was about to go back to the road\\nof yellow brick, she was startled to hear a deep groan near by.',\n",

       " 'Just then another groan reached their ears, and the sound seemed to\\ncome from behind them. They turned and walked through the forest a\\nfew steps, when Dorothy discovered something shining in a ray of\\nsunshine that fell between the trees. She ran to the place, and then\\nstopped short, with a cry of surprise.',\n",
       " 'One of the big trees had been partly chopped through, and standing\\nbeside it, with an uplifted axe in his hands, was a man made entirely\\nof tin. His head and arms and legs were jointed upon his body, but he\\nstood perfectly motionless, as if he could not stir at all.',\n",
       " 'Dorothy looked at him in amazement, and so did the Scarecrow, while\\nToto barked sharply and made a snap at the tin legs, which hurt his\\nteeth.',\n",
       " '\"Did you groan?\" asked Dorothy.',\n",
       " '\"Yes,\" answered the tin man; \"I did. I\\'ve been groaning for more than\\na year, and no one has ever heard me before or come to help me.\"',\n",
       " '\"What can I do for you?\" she enquired, softly, for she was moved by\\nthe sad voice in which the man spoke.',\n",
       " '\"Get an oil-can and oil my joints,\" he answered. \"They are rusted so\\nbadly that I cannot move them at all; if I am well oiled I shall soon\\nbe all right again. You will find an oil-can on a shelf in my cottage.\"',\n",
       " 'Dorothy at once ran back to the cottage and found the oil-can, and\\nthen she returned and asked, anxiously,',\n",
       " '\"Where are your joints?\"',\n",
       " '\"Oil my neck, first,\" replied the Tin Woodman. So she oiled it, and\\nas it was quite badly rusted the Scarecrow took hold of the tin head\\nand moved it gently from side to side until it worked freely, and\\nthen the man could turn it himself.',\n",
       " '\"Now oil the joints in my arms,\" he said. And Dorothy oiled them and\\nthe Scarecrow bent them carefully until they were quite free from\\nrust and as good as new.',\n",
       " 'The Tin Woodman gave a sigh of satisfaction and lowered his axe,\\nwhich he leaned against the tree.',\n",
       " '\"This is a great comfort,\" he said. \"I have been holding that axe in\\nthe air ever since I rusted, and I\\'m glad to be able to put it down\\nat last. Now, if you will oil the joints of my legs, I shall be all\\nright once more.\"',\n",
       " 'So they oiled his legs until he could move them freely; and he\\nthanked them again and again for his release, for he seemed a very\\npolite creature, and very grateful.',\n",
       " '\"I might have stood there always if you had not come along,\" he said;\\n\"so you have certainly saved my life. How did you happen to be here?\"',\n",
       " '\"We are on our way to the Emerald City, to see the great Oz,\" she\\nanswered, \"and we stopped at your cottage to pass the night.\"',\n",

       " '\"I want him to send me back to Kansas; and the Scarecrow wants him to\\nput a few brains into his head,\" she replied.',\n",

       " '\"Do you suppose Oz could give me a heart?\"',\n",
       " '\"Why, I guess so,\" Dorothy answered; \"it would be as easy as to give\\nthe Scarecrow brains.\"',\n",
       " '\"True,\" the Tin Woodman returned. \"So, if you will allow me to join\\nyour party, I will also go to the Emerald City and ask Oz to help me.\"',\n",
       " '\"Come along,\" said the Scarecrow, heartily; and Dorothy added\\nthat she would be pleased to have his company. So the Tin Woodman\\nshouldered his axe and they all passed through the forest until they\\ncame to the road that was paved with yellow brick.',\n",
       " 'The Tin Woodman had asked Dorothy to put the oil-can in her basket.\\n\"For,\" he said, \"if I should get caught in the rain, and rust again,\\nI would need the oil-can badly.\"',\n",
       " 'It was a bit of good luck to have their new comrade join the party,\\nfor soon after they had begun their journey again they came to a place\\nwhere the trees and branches grew so thick over the road that the\\ntravellers could not pass. But the Tin Woodman set to work with his axe\\nand chopped so well that soon he cleared a passage for the entire party.',\n",
       " 'Dorothy was thinking so earnestly as they walked along that she did\\nnot notice when the Scarecrow stumbled into a hole and rolled over to\\nthe side of the road. Indeed, he was obliged to call to her to help\\nhim up again.',\n",

       " '\"I don\\'t know enough,\" replied the Scarecrow, cheerfully. \"My head is\\nstuffed with straw, you know, and that is why I am going to Oz to ask\\nhim for some brains.\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, I see;\" said the Tin Woodman. \"But, after all, brains are not\\nthe best things in the world.\"',\n",
       " '\"Have you any?\" enquired the Scarecrow.',\n",
       " '\"No, my head is quite empty,\" answered the Woodman; \"but once I had\\nbrains, and a heart also; so, having tried them both, I should much\\nrather have a heart.\"',\n",
       " '\"And why is that?\" asked the Scarecrow.',\n",
       " '\"I will tell you my story, and then you will know.\"',\n",
       " 'So, while they were walking through the forest, the Tin Woodman told\\nthe following story:',\n",
       " '\"I was born the son of a woodman who chopped down trees in the\\nforest and sold the wood for a living. When I grew up I too became a\\nwood-chopper, and after my father died I took care of my old mother\\nas long as she lived. Then I made up my mind that instead of living\\nalone I would marry, so that I might not become lonely.',\n",
       " '\"There was one of the Munchkin girls who was so beautiful that I\\nsoon grew to love her with all my heart. She, on her part, promised\\nto marry me as soon as I could earn enough money to build a better\\nhouse for her; so I set to work harder than ever. But the girl lived\\nwith an old woman who did not want her to marry anyone, for she was\\nso lazy she wished the girl to remain with her and do the cooking\\nand the housework. So the old woman went to the wicked Witch of the\\nEast, and promised her two sheep and a cow if she would prevent the\\nmarriage. Thereupon the wicked Witch enchanted my axe, and when I was\\nchopping away at my best one day, for I was anxious to get the new\\nhouse and my wife as soon as possible, the axe slipped all at once\\nand cut off my left leg.',\n",
       " '\"This at first seemed a great misfortune, for I knew a one-legged man\\ncould not do very well as a wood-chopper. So I went to a tin-smith\\nand had him make me a new leg out of tin. The leg worked very well,\\nonce I was used to it; but my action angered the wicked Witch of\\nthe East, for she had promised the old woman I should not marry the\\npretty Munchkin girl. When I began chopping again my axe slipped and\\ncut off my right leg. Again I went to the tinner, and again he made\\nme a leg out of tin. After this the enchanted axe cut off my arms,\\none after the other; but, nothing daunted, I had them replaced with\\ntin ones. The wicked Witch then made the axe slip and cut off my\\nhead, and at first I thought that was the end of me. But the tinner\\nhappened to come along, and he made me a new head out of tin.',\n",
       " '\"I thought I had beaten the wicked Witch then, and I worked harder than\\never; but I little knew how cruel my enemy could be. She thought of a\\nnew way to kill my love for the beautiful Munchkin maiden, and made my\\naxe slip again, so that it cut right through my body, splitting me\\ninto two halves. Once more the tinner came to my help and made me a\\nbody of tin, fastening my tin arms and legs and head to it, by means of\\njoints, so that I could move around as well as ever. But, alas! I had\\nnow no heart, so that I lost all my love for the Munchkin girl, and did\\nnot care whether I married her or not. I suppose she is still living\\nwith the old woman, waiting for me to come after her.',\n",
       " '\"My body shone so brightly in the sun that I felt very proud of it\\nand it did not matter now if my axe slipped, for it could not cut me.\\nThere was only one danger--that my joints would rust; but I kept an\\noil-can in my cottage and took care to oil myself whenever I needed\\nit. However, there came a day when I forgot to do this, and, being\\ncaught in a rainstorm, before I thought of the danger my joints had\\nrusted, and I was left to stand in the woods until you came to help\\nme. It was a terrible thing to undergo, but during the year I stood\\nthere I had time to think that the greatest loss I had known was\\nthe loss of my heart. While I was in love I was the happiest man on\\nearth; but no one can love who has not a heart, and so I am resolved\\nto ask Oz to give me one. If he does, I will go back to the Munchkin\\nmaiden and marry her.\"',\n",
       " 'Both Dorothy and the Scarecrow had been greatly interested in the\\nstory of the Tin Woodman, and now they knew why he was so anxious to\\nget a new heart.',\n",

       " 'What worried her most was that the bread was nearly gone, and another\\nmeal for herself and Toto would empty the basket. To be sure neither\\nthe Woodman nor the Scarecrow ever ate anything, but she was not made\\nof tin nor straw, and could not live unless she was fed.',\n",

       " '\"No, but you tried to,\" she retorted. \"You are nothing but a big\\ncoward.\"',\n",
       " '\"I know it,\" said the Lion, hanging his head in shame; \"I\\'ve always\\nknown it. But how can I help it?\"',\n",
       " '\"I don\\'t know, I\\'m sure. To think of your striking a stuffed man,\\nlike the poor Scarecrow!\"',\n",
       " '\"Is he stuffed?\" asked the Lion, in surprise, as he watched her pick\\nup the Scarecrow and set him upon his feet, while she patted him into\\nshape again.',\n",
       " '\"Of course he\\'s stuffed,\" replied Dorothy, who was still angry.',\n",
       " '\"That\\'s why he went over so easily,\" remarked the Lion. \"It astonished\\nme to see him whirl around so. Is the other one stuffed, also?\"',\n",
       " '\"No,\" said Dorothy, \"he\\'s made of tin.\" And she helped the Woodman up\\nagain.',\n",
       " '\"That\\'s why he nearly blunted my claws,\" said the Lion. \"When they\\nscratched against the tin it made a cold shiver run down my back.\\nWhat is that little animal you are so tender of?\"',\n",
       " '\"He is my dog, Toto,\" answered Dorothy.',\n",
       " '\"Is he made of tin, or stuffed?\" asked the Lion.',\n",
       " '\"Neither. He\\'s a--a--a meat dog,\" said the girl.',\n",
       " '\"Oh. He\\'s a curious animal, and seems remarkably small, now that I\\nlook at him. No one would think of biting such a little thing except\\na coward like me,\" continued the Lion, sadly.',\n",
       " '\"What makes you a coward?\" asked Dorothy, looking at the great beast\\nin wonder, for he was as big as a small horse.',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s a mystery,\" replied the Lion. \"I suppose I was born that\\nway. All the other animals in the forest naturally expect me to be\\nbrave, for the Lion is everywhere thought to be the King of Beasts.\\nI learned that if I roared very loudly every living thing was\\nfrightened and got out of my way. Whenever I\\'ve met a man I\\'ve been\\nawfully scared; but I just roared at him, and he has always run away\\nas fast as he could go. If the elephants and the tigers and the bears\\nhad ever tried to fight me, I should have run myself--I\\'m such a\\ncoward; but just as soon as they hear me roar they all try to get\\naway from me, and of course I let them go.\"',\n",
       " '\"But that isn\\'t right. The King of Beasts shouldn\\'t be a coward,\"\\nsaid the Scarecrow.',\n",
       " '\"I know it,\" returned the Lion, wiping a tear from his eye with the\\ntip of his tail; \"it is my great sorrow, and makes my life very\\nunhappy. But whenever there is danger my heart begins to beat fast.\"',\n",
       " '\"Perhaps you have heart disease,\" said the Tin Woodman.',\n",
       " '\"It may be,\" said the Lion.',\n",
       " '\"If you have,\" continued the Tin Woodman, \"you ought to be glad, for\\nit proves you have a heart. For my part, I have no heart; so I cannot\\nhave heart disease.\"',\n",
       " '\"Perhaps,\" said the Lion, thoughtfully, \"if I had no heart I should\\nnot be a coward.\"',\n",
       " '\"Have you brains?\" asked the Scarecrow.',\n",
       " '\"I suppose so. I\\'ve never looked to see,\" replied the Lion.',\n",
       " '\"I am going to the great Oz to ask him to give me some,\" remarked the\\nScarecrow, \"for my head is stuffed with straw.\"',\n",
       " '\"And I am going to ask him to give me a heart,\" said the Woodman.',\n",
       " '\"And I am going to ask him to send Toto and me back to Kansas,\" added\\nDorothy.',\n",
       " '\"Do you think Oz could give me courage?\" asked the cowardly Lion.',\n",
       " '\"Just as easily as he could give me brains,\" said the Scarecrow.',\n",
       " '\"Or give me a heart,\" said the Tin Woodman.',\n",
       " '\"Or send me back to Kansas,\" said Dorothy.',\n",
       " '\"Then, if you don\\'t mind, I\\'ll go with you,\" said the Lion, \"for my\\nlife is simply unbearable without a bit of courage.\"',\n",
       " '\"You will be very welcome,\" answered Dorothy, \"for you will help to\\nkeep away the other wild beasts. It seems to me they must be more\\ncowardly than you are if they allow you to scare them so easily.\"',\n",
       " '\"They really are,\" said the Lion; \"but that doesn\\'t make me any braver,\\nand as long as I know myself to be a coward I shall be unhappy.\"',\n",
       " \"So once more the little company set off upon the journey, the Lion\\nwalking with stately strides at Dorothy's side. Toto did not approve\\nthis new comrade at first, for he could not forget how nearly he\\nhad been crushed between the Lion's great jaws; but after a time he\\nbecame more at ease, and presently Toto and the Cowardly Lion had\\ngrown to be good friends.\",\n",
       " \"During the rest of that day there was no other adventure to mar the\\npeace of their journey. Once, indeed, the Tin Woodman stepped upon a\\nbeetle that was crawling along the road, and killed the poor little\\nthing. This made the Tin Woodman very unhappy, for he was always\\ncareful not to hurt any living creature; and as he walked along he\\nwept several tears of sorrow and regret. These tears ran slowly down\\nhis face and over the hinges of his jaw, and there they rusted.\\nWhen Dorothy presently asked him a question the Tin Woodman could\\nnot open his mouth, for his jaws were tightly rusted together. He\\nbecame greatly frightened at this and made many motions to Dorothy to\\nrelieve him, but she could not understand. The Lion was also puzzled\\nto know what was wrong. But the Scarecrow seized the oil-can from\\nDorothy's basket and oiled the Woodman's jaws, so that after a few\\nmoments he could talk as well as before.\",\n",
       " '\"This will serve me a lesson,\" said he, \"to look where I step. For if\\nI should kill another bug or beetle I should surely cry again, and\\ncrying rusts my jaw so that I cannot speak.\"',\n",
       " 'Thereafter he walked very carefully, with his eyes on the road,\\nand when he saw a tiny ant toiling by he would step over it, so as\\nnot to harm it. The Tin Woodman knew very well he had no heart, and\\ntherefore he took great care never to be cruel or unkind to anything.',\n",
       " '\"You people with hearts,\" he said, \"have something to guide you,\\nand need never do wrong; but I have no heart, and so I must be very\\ncareful. When Oz gives me a heart of course I needn\\'t mind so much.\"',\n",
       " 'They were obliged to camp out that night under a large tree in the\\nforest, for there were no houses near. The tree made a good, thick\\ncovering to protect them from the dew, and the Tin Woodman chopped a\\ngreat pile of wood with his axe and Dorothy built a splendid fire that\\nwarmed her and made her feel less lonely. She and Toto ate the last of\\ntheir bread, and now she did not know what they would do for breakfast.',\n",
       " '\"If you wish,\" said the Lion, \"I will go into the forest and kill a\\ndeer for you. You can roast it by the fire, since your tastes are so\\npeculiar that you prefer cooked food, and then you will have a very\\ngood breakfast.\"',\n",
       " '\"Don\\'t! please don\\'t,\" begged the Tin Woodman. \"I should certainly\\nweep if you killed a poor deer, and then my jaws would rust again.\"',\n",
       " \"But the Lion went away into the forest and found his own supper, and no\\none ever knew what it was, for he didn't mention it. And the Scarecrow\\nfound a tree full of nuts and filled Dorothy's basket with them, so\\nthat she would not be hungry for a long time. She thought this was very\\nkind and thoughtful of the Scarecrow, but she laughed heartily at the\\nawkward way in which the poor creature picked up the nuts. His padded\\nhands were so clumsy and the nuts were so small that he dropped almost\\nas many as he put in the basket. But the Scarecrow did not mind how\\nlong it took him to fill the basket, for it enabled him to keep away\\nfrom the fire, as he feared a spark might get into his straw and burn\\nhim up. So he kept a good distance away from the flames, and only came\\nnear to cover Dorothy with dry leaves when she lay down to sleep. These\\nkept her very snug and warm and she slept soundly until morning.\",\n",
       " 'When it was daylight the girl bathed her face in a little rippling\\nbrook and soon after they all started toward the Emerald City.',\n",
       " 'This was to be an eventful day for the travellers. They had hardly\\nbeen walking an hour when they saw before them a great ditch that\\ncrossed the road and divided the forest as far as they could see on\\neither side. It was a very wide ditch, and when they crept up to the\\nedge and looked into it they could see it was also very deep, and\\nthere were many big, jagged rocks at the bottom. The sides were so\\nsteep that none of them could climb down, and for a moment it seemed\\nthat their journey must end.',\n",
       " '\"What shall we do?\" asked Dorothy, despairingly.',\n",
       " '\"I haven\\'t the faintest idea,\" said the Tin Woodman; and the Lion\\nshook his shaggy mane and looked thoughtful. But the Scarecrow said:',\n",
       " '\"We cannot fly, that is certain; neither can we climb down into this\\ngreat ditch. Therefore, if we cannot jump over it, we must stop where\\nwe are.\"',\n",
       " '\"I think I could jump over it,\" said the Cowardly Lion, after\\nmeasuring the distance carefully in his mind.',\n",
       " '\"Then we are all right,\" answered the Scarecrow, \"for you can carry\\nus all over on your back, one at a time.\"',\n",
       " '\"Well, I\\'ll try it,\" said the Lion. \"Who will go first?\"',\n",
       " '\"I will,\" declared the Scarecrow; \"for, if you found that you could\\nnot jump over the gulf, Dorothy would be killed, or the Tin Woodman\\nbadly dented on the rocks below. But if I am on your back it will not\\nmatter so much, for the fall would not hurt me at all.\"',\n",
       " '\"I am terribly afraid of falling, myself,\" said the Cowardly Lion,\\n\"but I suppose there is nothing to do but try it. So get on my back\\nand we will make the attempt.\"',\n",
       " \"The Scarecrow sat upon the Lion's back, and the big beast walked to\\nthe edge of the gulf and crouched down.\",\n",
       " '\"Why don\\'t you run and jump?\" asked the Scarecrow.',\n",
       " '\"Because that isn\\'t the way we Lions do these things,\" he replied.\\nThen giving a great spring, he shot through the air and landed safely\\non the other side. They were all greatly pleased to see how easily he\\ndid it, and after the Scarecrow had got down from his back the Lion\\nsprang across the ditch again.',\n",
       " \"Dorothy thought she would go next; so she took Toto in her arms and\\nclimbed on the Lion's back, holding tightly to his mane with one\\nhand. The next moment it seemed as if she was flying through the air;\\nand then, before she had time to think about it, she was safe on the\\nother side. The Lion went back a third time and got the Tin Woodman,\\nand then they all sat down for a few moments to give the beast a\\nchance to rest, for his great leaps had made his breath short, and he\\npanted like a big dog that has been running too long.\",\n",
       " 'They found the forest very thick on this side, and it looked dark\\nand gloomy. After the Lion had rested they started along the road\\nof yellow brick, silently wondering, each in his own mind, if ever\\nthey would come to the end of the woods and reach the bright sunshine\\nagain. To add to their discomfort, they soon heard strange noises in\\nthe depths of the forest, and the Lion whispered to them that it was\\nin this part of the country that the Kalidahs lived.',\n",
       " '\"What are the Kalidahs?\" asked the girl.',\n",
       " '\"They are monstrous beasts with bodies like bears and heads like\\ntigers,\" replied the Lion; \"and with claws so long and sharp that\\nthey could tear me in two as easily as I could kill Toto. I\\'m\\nterribly afraid of the Kalidahs.\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m not surprised that you are,\" returned Dorothy \"They must be\\ndreadful beasts.\"',\n",
       " 'The Lion was about to reply when suddenly they came to another gulf\\nacross the road; but this one was so broad and deep that the Lion\\nknew at once he could not leap across it.',\n",

       " '\"Here is a great tree, standing close to the ditch. If the Tin\\nWoodman can chop it down, so that it will fall to the other side, we\\ncan walk across it easily.\"',\n",
       " '\"That is a first rate idea,\" said the Lion. \"One would almost suspect\\nyou had brains in your head, instead of straw.\"',\n",
       " 'The Woodman set to work at once, and so sharp was his axe that the\\ntree was soon chopped nearly through. Then the Lion put his strong\\nfront legs against the tree and pushed with all his might, and slowly\\nthe big tree tipped and fell with a crash across the ditch, with its\\ntop branches on the other side.',\n",
       " 'They had just started to cross this queer bridge when a sharp growl\\nmade them all look up, and to their horror they saw running toward\\nthem two great beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers.',\n",

       " 'But, seeing they were bigger than the Lion, and remembering that\\nthere were two of them and only one of him, the Kalidahs again rushed\\nforward, and the Lion crossed over the tree and turned to see what\\nthey would do next. Without stopping an instant the fierce beasts\\nalso began to cross the tree, and the Lion said to Dorothy,',\n",
       " '\"We are lost, for they will surely tear us to pieces with their sharp\\nclaws. But stand close behind me, and I will fight them as long as I\\nam alive.\"',\n",
       " '\"Wait a minute!\" called the Scarecrow. He had been thinking what was\\nbest to be done, and now he asked the Woodman to chop away the end\\nof the tree that rested on their side of the ditch. The Tin Woodman\\nbegan to use his axe at once, and, just as the two Kalidahs were\\nnearly across, the tree fell with a crash into the gulf, carrying the\\nugly, snarling brutes with it, and both were dashed to pieces on the\\nsharp rocks at the bottom.',\n",
       " '\"Well,\" said the Cowardly Lion, drawing a long breath of relief, \"I\\nsee we are going to live a little while longer, and I am glad of it,\\nfor it must be a very uncomfortable thing not to be alive. Those\\ncreatures frightened me so badly that my heart is beating yet.\"',\n",
       " '\"Ah.\" said the Tin Woodman, sadly, \"I wish I had a heart to beat.\"',\n",
       " \"This adventure made the travellers more anxious than ever to get out of\\nthe forest, and they walked so fast that Dorothy became tired, and had\\nto ride on the Lion's back. To their great joy the trees became thinner\\nthe further they advanced, and in the afternoon they suddenly came upon\\na broad river, flowing swiftly just before them. On the other side of\\nthe water they could see the road of yellow brick running through a\\nbeautiful country, with green meadows dotted with bright flowers and\\nall the road bordered with trees hanging full of delicious fruits. They\\nwere greatly pleased to see this delightful country before them.\",\n",
       " '\"How shall we cross the river?\" asked Dorothy.',\n",
       " '\"That is easily done,\" replied the Scarecrow. \"The Tin Woodman must\\nbuild us a raft, so we can float to the other side.\"',\n",
       " 'So the Woodman took his axe and began to chop down small trees to make\\na raft, and while he was busy at this the Scarecrow found on the river\\nbank a tree full of fine fruit. This pleased Dorothy, who had eaten\\nnothing but nuts all day, and she made a hearty meal of the ripe fruit.',\n",
       " 'But it takes time to make a raft, even when one is as industrious and\\nuntiring as the Tin Woodman, and when night came the work was not done.\\nSo they found a cozy place under the trees where they slept well until\\nthe morning; and Dorothy dreamed of the Emerald City, and of the good\\nWizard Oz, who would soon send her back to her own home again.',\n",
       " 'Our little party of travellers awakened next morning refreshed and\\nfull of hope, and Dorothy breakfasted like a princess off peaches and\\nplums from the trees beside the river.',\n",

       " 'To be sure, the broad river now cut them off from this beautiful\\nland; but the raft was nearly done, and after the Tin Woodman had cut\\na few more logs and fastened them together with wooden pins, they\\nwere ready to start. Dorothy sat down in the middle of the raft and\\nheld Toto in her arms. When the Cowardly Lion stepped upon the raft\\nit tipped badly, for he was big and heavy; but the Scarecrow and the\\nTin Woodman stood upon the other end to steady it, and they had long\\npoles in their hands to push the raft through the water.',\n",
       " 'They got along quite well at first, but when they reached the middle\\nof the river the swift current swept the raft down stream, farther\\nand farther away from the road of yellow brick; and the water grew so\\ndeep that the long poles would not touch the bottom.',\n",
       " '\"This is bad,\" said the Tin Woodman, \"for if we cannot get to the\\nland we shall be carried into the country of the wicked Witch of the\\nWest, and she will enchant us and make us her slaves.\"',\n",

       " '\"And I should never get back to Kansas,\" said Dorothy.',\n",
       " '\"We must certainly get to the Emerald City if we can,\" the Scarecrow\\ncontinued, and he pushed so hard on his long pole that it stuck fast\\nin the mud at the bottom of the river, and before he could pull it\\nout again, or let go, the raft was swept away and the poor Scarecrow\\nleft clinging to the pole in the middle of the river.',\n",
       " '\"Good bye!\" he called after them, and they were very sorry to leave\\nhim; indeed, the Tin Woodman began to cry, but fortunately remembered\\nthat he might rust, and so dried his tears on Dorothy\\'s apron.',\n",
       " 'Of course this was a bad thing for the Scarecrow.',\n",
       " '\"I am now worse off than when I first met Dorothy,\" he thought.\\n\"Then, I was stuck on a pole in a cornfield, where I could make\\nbelieve scare the crows, at any rate; but surely there is no use for\\na Scarecrow stuck on a pole in the middle of a river.

       " 'Down the stream the raft floated, and the poor Scarecrow was left far\\nbehind. Then the Lion said:',\n",

       " \"So he sprang into the water and the Tin Woodman caught fast hold\\nof his tail, when the Lion began to swim with all his might toward\\nthe shore.

The flowers had been too strong for\\nthe huge beast and he had given up, at last, and fallen only a short\\ndistance from the end of the poppy-bed, where the sweet grass spread\\nin beautiful green fields before them.',\n",
       " '\"We can do nothing for him,\" said the Tin Woodman, sadly; \"for he is\\nmuch too heavy to lift. We must leave him here to sleep on forever,\\nand perhaps he will dream that he has found courage at last.\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m sorry,\" said the Scarecrow; \"the Lion was a very good comrade\\nfor one so cowardly. But let us go on.\"',\n",
       " 'They carried the sleeping girl to a pretty spot beside the river,\\nfar enough from the poppy field to prevent her breathing any more of\\nthe poison of the flowers, and here they laid her gently on the soft\\ngrass and waited for the fresh breeze to waken her.',\n",
       " '\"We cannot be far from the road of yellow brick, now,\" remarked the\\nScarecrow, as he stood beside the girl, \"for we have come nearly as\\nfar as the river carried us away.\"',\n",
       " 'The Tin Woodman was about to reply when he heard a low growl, and\\nturning his head (which worked beautifully on hinges) he saw a\\nstrange beast come bounding over the grass towards them. It was,\\nindeed, a great, yellow wildcat, and the Woodman thought it must be\\nchasing something, for its ears were lying close to its head and its\\nmouth was wide open, showing two rows of ugly teeth, while its red\\neyes glowed like balls of fire. As it came nearer the Tin Woodman\\nsaw that running before the beast was a little gray field-mouse, and\\nalthough he had no heart he knew it was wrong for the wildcat to try\\nto kill such a pretty, harmless creature.',\n",
       " \"So the Woodman raised his axe, and as the wildcat ran by he gave it a\\nquick blow that cut the beast's head clean off from its body, and it\\nrolled over at his feet in two pieces.\",\n",
       " 'The field-mouse, now that it was freed from its enemy, stopped short;\\nand coming slowly up to the Woodman it said, in a squeaky little voice,',\n",
       " '\"Oh, thank you! Thank you ever so much for saving my life.\"',\n",
       " '\"Don\\'t speak of it, I beg of you,\" replied the Woodman. \"I have no\\nheart, you know, so I am careful to help all those who may need a\\nfriend, even if it happens to be only a mouse.\"',\n",
       " '\"Only a mouse!\" cried the little animal, indignantly; \"why, I am a\\nQueen--the Queen of all the field-mice!\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, indeed,\" said the Woodman, making a bow.',\n",
       " '\"Therefore you have done a great deed, as well as a brave one, in\\nsaving my life,\" added the Queen.',\n",
       " 'At that moment several mice were seen running up as fast as their\\nlittle legs could carry them, and when they saw their Queen they\\nexclaimed,',\n",
       " '\"_Permit me to introduce to you her Majesty, the Queen._',\n",
       " '\"Oh, your Majesty, we thought you would be killed! How did you manage\\nto escape the great Wildcat?\" and they all bowed so low to the\\nlittle Queen that they almost stood upon their heads.',\n",
       " '\"This funny tin man,\" she answered, \"killed the Wildcat and saved my\\nlife. So hereafter you must all serve him, and obey his slightest wish.\"',\n",
       " '\"We will!\" cried all the mice, in a shrill chorus. And then they\\nscampered in all directions, for Toto had awakened from his sleep,\\nand seeing all these mice around him he gave one bark of delight and\\njumped right into the middle of the group. Toto had always loved to\\nchase mice when he lived in Kansas, and he saw no harm in it.',\n",
       " 'But the Tin Woodman caught the dog in his arms and held him tight,\\nwhile he called to the mice: \"Come back! come back! Toto shall not\\nhurt you.\"',\n",
       " 'At this the Queen of the Mice stuck her head out from a clump of\\ngrass and asked, in a timid voice,',\n",
       " '\"Are you sure he will not bite us?\"',\n",
       " '\"I will not let him,\" said the Woodman; \"so do not be afraid.\"',\n",
       " \"One by one the mice came creeping back, and Toto did not bark again,\\nalthough he tried to get out of the Woodman's arms, and would have\\nbitten him had he not known very well he was made of tin. Finally one\\nof the biggest mice spoke.\",\n",
       " '\"Is there anything we can do,\" it asked, \"to repay you for saving the\\nlife of our Queen?\"',\n",
       " '\"Nothing that I know of,\" answered the Woodman; but the Scarecrow,\\nwho had been trying to think, but could not because his head was\\nstuffed with straw, said, quickly,',\n",
       " '\"Oh, yes; you can save our friend, the Cowardly Lion, who is asleep\\nin the poppy bed.\"',\n",
       " '\"A Lion!\" cried the little Queen; \"why, he would eat us all up.\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, no;\" declared the Scarecrow; \"this Lion is a coward.\"',\n",
       " '\"Really?\" asked the Mouse.',\n",
       " '\"He says so himself,\" answered the Scarecrow, \"and he would never\\nhurt anyone who is our friend. If you will help us to save him I\\npromise that he shall treat you all with kindness.\"',\n",
       " '\"Very well,\" said the Queen, \"we will trust you. But what shall we do?\"',\n",
       " '\"Are there many of these mice which call you Queen and are willing to\\nobey you?\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, yes; there are thousands,\" she replied.',\n",
       " '\"Then send for them all to come here as soon as possible, and let\\neach one bring a long piece of string.\"',\n",
       " 'The Queen turned to the mice that attended her and told them to go at\\nonce and get all her people. As soon as they heard her orders they\\nran away in every direction as fast as possible.',\n",
       " '\"Now,\" said the Scarecrow to the Tin Woodman, \"you must go to those\\ntrees by the river-side and make a truck that will carry the Lion.\"',\n",
       " 'So the Woodman went at once to the trees and began to work; and he\\nsoon made a truck out of the limbs of trees, from which he chopped\\naway all the leaves and branches. He fastened it together with\\nwooden pegs and made the four wheels out of short pieces of a big\\ntree-trunk. So fast and so well did he work that by the time the mice\\nbegan to arrive the truck was all ready for them.',\n",
       " 'They came from all directions, and there were thousands of them: big\\nmice and little mice and middle-sized mice; and each one brought a\\npiece of string in his mouth. It was about this time that Dorothy woke\\nfrom her long sleep and opened her eyes. She was greatly astonished\\nto find herself lying upon the grass, with thousands of mice standing\\naround and looking at her timidly. But the Scarecrow told her about\\neverything, and turning to the dignified little Mouse, he said,',\n",
       " '\"Permit me to introduce to you her Majesty, the Queen.\"',\n",
       " 'Dorothy nodded gravely and the Queen made a courtesy, after which she\\nbecame quite friendly with the little girl.',\n",
       " 'The Scarecrow and the Woodman now began to fasten the mice to the\\ntruck, using the strings they had brought. One end of a string was\\ntied around the neck of each mouse and the other end to the truck.\\nOf course the truck was a thousand times bigger than any of the mice\\nwho were to draw it; but when all the mice had been harnessed they\\nwere able to pull it quite easily. Even the Scarecrow and the Tin\\nWoodman could sit on it, and were drawn swiftly by their queer little\\nhorses to the place where the Lion lay asleep.',\n",
       " 'After a great deal of hard work, for the Lion was heavy, they managed\\nto get him up on the truck. Then the Queen hurriedly gave her people\\nthe order to start, for she feared if the mice stayed among the\\npoppies too long they also would fall asleep.',\n",
       " 'At first the little creatures, many though they were, could hardly stir\\nthe heavily loaded truck; but the Woodman and the Scarecrow both pushed\\nfrom behind, and they got along better. Soon they rolled the Lion out\\nof the poppy bed to the green fields, where he could breathe the sweet,\\nfresh air again, instead of the poisonous scent of the flowers.',\n",
       " 'Dorothy came to meet them and thanked the little mice warmly for\\nsaving her companion from death. She had grown so fond of the big\\nLion she was glad he had been rescued.',\n",
       " 'Then the mice were unharnessed from the truck and scampered away\\nthrough the grass to their homes. The Queen of the Mice was the last\\nto leave.',\n",
       " '\"If ever you need us again,\" she said, \"come out into the field and\\ncall, and we shall hear you and come to your assistance. Good bye!\"',\n",
       " '\"Good bye!\" they all answered, and away the Queen ran, while Dorothy\\nheld Toto tightly lest he should run after her and frighten her.',\n",
       " 'After this they sat down beside the Lion until he should awaken; and\\nthe Scarecrow brought Dorothy some fruit from a tree near by, which\\nshe ate for her dinner.',\n",
       " 'It was some time before the Cowardly Lion awakened, for he had lain\\namong the poppies a long while, breathing in their deadly fragrance;\\nbut when he did open his eyes and roll off the truck he was very glad\\nto find himself still alive.',\n",
       " '\"I ran as fast as I could,\" he said, sitting down and yawning; \"but\\nthe flowers were too strong for me. How did you get me out?\"',\n",
       " 'Then they told him of the field-mice, and how they had generously\\nsaved him from death; and the Cowardly Lion laughed, and said,',\n",
       " '\"I have always thought myself very big and terrible; yet such small\\nthings as flowers came near to killing me, and such small animals as\\nmice have saved my life. How strange it all is! But, comrades, what\\nshall we do now?\"',\n",
       " '\"We must journey on until we find the road of yellow brick again,\"\\nsaid Dorothy; \"and then we can keep on to the Emerald City.\"',\n",
       " 'So, the Lion being fully refreshed, and feeling quite himself again,\\nthey all started upon the journey, greatly enjoying the walk through\\nthe soft, fresh grass; and it was not long before they reached the\\nroad of yellow brick and turned again toward the Emerald City where\\nthe great Oz dwelt.',\n",
       " 'The road was smooth and well paved, now, and the country about was\\nbeautiful; so that the travelers rejoiced in leaving the forest far\\nbehind, and with it the many dangers they had met in its gloomy\\nshades. Once more they could see fences built beside the road; but\\nthese were painted green, and when they came to a small house, in\\nwhich a farmer evidently lived, that also was painted green. They\\npassed by several of these houses during the afternoon, and sometimes\\npeople came to the doors and looked at them as if they would like to\\nask questions; but no one came near them nor spoke to them because of\\nthe great Lion, of which they were much afraid. The people were all\\ndressed in clothing of a lovely emerald green color and wore peaked\\nhats like those of the Munchkins.',\n",
       " '\"This must be the Land of Oz,\" said Dorothy, \"and we are surely\\ngetting near the Emerald City.\"',\n",
       " '\"Yes,\" answered the Scarecrow; \"everything is green here, while in\\nthe country of the Munchkins blue was the favorite color. But the\\npeople do not seem to be as friendly as the Munchkins and I\\'m afraid\\nwe shall be unable to find a place to pass the night.\"',\n",
       " '\"I should like something to eat besides fruit,\" said the girl, \"and\\nI\\'m sure Toto is nearly starved. Let us stop at the next house and\\ntalk to the people.\"',\n",
       " 'So, when they came to a good sized farm house, Dorothy walked boldly\\nup to the door and knocked. A woman opened it just far enough to look\\nout, and said,',\n",
       " '\"What do you want, child, and why is that great Lion with you?\"',\n",
       " '\"We wish to pass the night with you, if you will allow us,\" answered\\nDorothy; \"and the Lion is my friend and comrade, and would not hurt\\nyou for the world.\"',\n",
       " '\"Is he tame?\" asked the woman, opening the door a little wider.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, yes;\" said the girl, \"and he is a great coward, too; so that he\\nwill be more afraid of you than you are of him.\"',\n",
       " '\"Well,\" said the woman, after thinking it over and taking another\\npeep at the Lion, \"if that is the case you may come in, and I will\\ngive you some supper and a place to sleep.\"',\n",
       " 'So they all entered the house, where there were, besides the woman,\\ntwo children and a man. The man had hurt his leg, and was lying on the\\ncouch in a corner. They seemed greatly surprised to see so strange a\\ncompany, and while the woman was busy laying the table the man asked,',\n",
       " '\"Where are you all going?\"',\n",
       " '\"To the Emerald City,\" said Dorothy, \"to see the Great Oz.\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, indeed!\" exclaimed the man. \"Are you sure that Oz will see you?\"',\n",
       " '\"Why not?\" she replied.',\n",
       " '\"Why, it is said that he never lets any one come into his presence. I\\nhave been to the Emerald City many times, and it is a beautiful and\\nwonderful place; but I have never been permitted to see the Great Oz,\\nnor do I know of any living person who has seen him.\"',\n",
       " '\"Does he never go out?\" asked the Scarecrow.',\n",
       " '\"Never. He sits day after day in the great throne room of his palace,\\nand even those who wait upon him do not see him face to face.\"',\n",
       " '\"What is he like?\" asked the girl.',\n",
       " '\"That is hard to tell,\" said the man, thoughtfully. \"You see, Oz is a\\ngreat Wizard, and can take on any form he wishes. So that some say he\\nlooks like a bird; and some say he looks like an elephant; and some\\nsay he looks like a cat. To others he appears as a beautiful fairy,\\nor a brownie, or in any other form that pleases him. But who the real\\nOz is, when he is in his own form, no living person can tell.\"',\n",
       " '\"That is very strange,\" said Dorothy; \"but we must try, in some way,\\nto see him, or we shall have made our journey for nothing.\"',\n",
       " '\"Why do you wish to see the terrible Oz?\" asked the man.',\n",
       " '\"I want him to give me some brains,\" said the Scarecrow, eagerly.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, Oz could do that easily enough,\" declared the man. \"He has more\\nbrains than he needs.\"',\n",
       " '\"And I want him to give me a heart,\" said the Tin Woodman.',\n",
       " '\"That will not trouble him,\" continued the man, \"for Oz has a large\\ncollection of hearts, of all sizes and shapes.\"',\n",
       " '\"And I want him to give me courage,\" said the Cowardly Lion.',\n",
       " '\"Oz keeps a great pot of courage in his throne room,\" said the man,\\n\"which he has covered with a golden plate, to keep it from running\\nover. He will be glad to give you some.\"',\n",
       " '\"And I want him to send me back to Kansas,\" said Dorothy.',\n",
       " '\"Where is Kansas?\" asked the man, in surprise.',\n",
       " '\"I don\\'t know,\" replied Dorothy, sorrowfully; \"but it is my home, and\\nI\\'m sure it\\'s somewhere.\"',\n",
       " '\"Very likely. Well, Oz can do anything; so I suppose he will find\\nKansas for you. But first you must get to see him, and that will be\\na hard task; for the great Wizard does not like to see anyone, and\\nhe usually has his own way. But what do you want?\" he continued,\\nspeaking to Toto. Toto only wagged his tail; for, strange to say, he\\ncould not speak.\\n\"_The Lion ate some of the porridge._\"',\n",
       " 'The woman now called to them that supper was ready, so they gathered\\naround the table and Dorothy ate some delicious porridge and a dish of\\nscrambled eggs and a plate of nice white bread, and enjoyed her meal.\\nThe Lion ate some of the porridge, but did not care for it, saying it\\nwas made from oats and oats were food for horses, not for lions. The\\nScarecrow and the Tin Woodman ate nothing at all. Toto ate a little of\\neverything, and was glad to get a good supper again.',\n",
       " 'The woman now gave Dorothy a bed to sleep in, and Toto lay down beside\\nher, while the Lion guarded the door of her room so she might not be\\ndisturbed. The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman stood up in a corner and\\nkept quiet all night, although of course they could not sleep.',\n",
       " 'The next morning, as soon as the sun was up, they started on their\\nway, and soon saw a beautiful green glow in the sky just before them.',\n",
       " '\"That must be the Emerald City,\" said Dorothy.',\n",
       " 'As they walked on, the green glow became brighter and brighter, and it\\nseemed that at last they were nearing the end of their travels. Yet it\\nwas afternoon before they came to the great wall that surrounded the\\nCity. It was high, and thick, and of a bright green color.',\n",
       " 'In front of them, and at the end of the road of yellow brick, was a big\\ngate, all studded with emeralds that glittered so in the sun that even\\nthe painted eyes of the Scarecrow were dazzled by their brilliancy.',\n",
       " 'There was a bell beside the gate, and Dorothy pushed the button and\\nheard a silvery tinkle sound within. Then the big gate swung slowly\\nopen, and they all passed through and found themselves in a high\\narched room, the walls of which glistened with countless emeralds.',\n",
       " 'Before them stood a little man about the same size as the Munchkins.\\nHe was clothed all in green, from his head to his feet, and even his\\nskin was of a greenish tint. At his side was a large green box.',\n",
       " 'When he saw Dorothy and her companions the man asked,',\n",
       " '\"What do you wish in the Emerald City?\"',\n",
       " '\"We came here to see the Great Oz,\" said Dorothy.',\n",
       " 'The man was so surprised at this answer that he sat down to think it\\nover.',\n",
       " '\"It has been many years since anyone asked me to see Oz,\" he said,\\nshaking his head in perplexity. \"He is powerful and terrible, and if\\nyou come on an idle or foolish errand to bother the wise reflections of\\nthe Great Wizard, he might be angry and destroy you all in an instant.\"',\n",
       " '\"But it is not a foolish errand, nor an idle one,\" replied the\\nScarecrow; \"it is important. And we have been told that Oz is a good\\nWizard.\"',\n",
       " '\"So he is,\" said the green man; \"and he rules the Emerald City wisely\\nand well. But to those who are not honest, or who approach him from\\ncuriosity, he is most terrible, and few have ever dared ask to see\\nhis face. I am the Guardian of the Gates, and since you demand to see\\nthe Great Oz I must take you to his palace. But first you must put on\\nthe spectacles.\"',\n",
       " '\"Why?\" asked Dorothy.',\n",
       " '\"Because if you did not wear spectacles the brightness and glory of\\nthe Emerald City would blind you. Even those who live in the City\\nmust wear spectacles night and day. They are all locked on, for Oz\\nso ordered it when the City was first built, and I have the only key\\nthat will unlock them.\"',\n",
       " 'He opened the big box, and Dorothy saw that it was filled with\\nspectacles of every size and shape. All of them had green glasses\\nin them. The Guardian of the gates found a pair that would just fit\\nDorothy and put them over her eyes. There were two golden bands\\nfastened to them that passed around the back of her head, where they\\nwere locked together by a little key that was at the end of a chain the\\nGuardian of the Gates wore around his neck. When they were on, Dorothy\\ncould not take them off had she wished, but of course she did not want\\nto be blinded by the glare of the Emerald City, so she said nothing.',\n",
       " 'Then the green man fitted spectacles for the Scarecrow and the Tin\\nWoodman and the Lion, and even on little Toto; and all were locked\\nfast with the key.',\n",
       " 'Then the Guardian of the Gates put on his own glasses and told them\\nhe was ready to show them to the palace. Taking a big golden key from\\na peg on the wall he opened another gate, and they all followed him\\nthrough the portal into the streets of the Emerald City.',\n",
       " 'Even with eyes protected by the green spectacles Dorothy and her\\nfriends were at first dazzled by the brilliancy of the wonderful City.\\nThe streets were lined with beautiful houses all built of green marble\\nand studded everywhere with sparkling emeralds. They walked over a\\npavement of the same green marble, and where the blocks were joined\\ntogether were rows of emeralds, set closely, and glittering in the\\nbrightness of the sun. The window panes were of green glass; even the\\nsky above the City had a green tint, and the rays of the sun were green.',\n",
       " 'There were many people, men, women and children, walking about, and\\nthese were all dressed in green clothes and had greenish skins. They\\nlooked at Dorothy and her strangely assorted company with wondering\\neyes, and the children all ran away and hid behind their mothers when\\nthey saw the Lion; but no one spoke to them. Many shops stood in the\\nstreet, and Dorothy saw that everything in them was green. Green\\ncandy and green pop-corn were offered for sale, as well as green\\nshoes, green hats and green clothes of all sorts. At one place a man\\nwas selling green lemonade, and when the children bought it Dorothy\\ncould see that they paid for it with green pennies.',\n",
       " 'There seemed to be no horses nor animals of any kind; the men carried\\nthings around in little green carts, which they pushed before them.\\nEveryone seemed happy and contented and prosperous.',\n",
       " 'The Guardian of the Gates led them through the streets until they\\ncame to a big building, exactly in the middle of the City, which was\\nthe Palace of Oz, the Great Wizard. There was a soldier before the\\ndoor, dressed in a green uniform and wearing a long green beard.',\n",
       " '\"Here are strangers,\" said the Guardian of the Gates to him, \"and\\nthey demand to see the Great Oz.\"',\n",
       " '\"Step inside,\" answered the soldier, \"and I will carry your message\\nto him.\"',\n",
       " 'So they passed through the Palace gates and were led into a big room\\nwith a green carpet and lovely green furniture set with emeralds.\\nThe soldier made them all wipe their feet upon a green mat before\\nentering this room, and when they were seated he said, politely,',\n",
       " '\"Please make yourselves comfortable while I go to the door of the\\nThrone Room and tell Oz you are here.\"',\n",
       " 'They had to wait a long time before the soldier returned. When, at\\nlast, he came back, Dorothy asked,',\n",
       " '\"Have you seen Oz?\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, no;\" returned the soldier; \"I have never seen him. But I spoke\\nto him as he sat behind his screen, and gave him your message. He\\nsays he will grant you an audience, if you so desire; but each one\\nof you must enter his presence alone, and he will admit but one each\\nday. Therefore, as you must remain in the Palace for several days, I\\nwill have you shown to rooms where you may rest in comfort after your\\njourney.\"',\n",
       " '\"Thank you,\" replied the girl; \"that is very kind of Oz.\"',\n",
       " 'The soldier now blew upon a green whistle, and at once a young girl,\\ndressed in a pretty green silk gown, entered the room. She had\\nlovely green hair and green eyes, and she bowed low before Dorothy as\\nshe said,',\n",
       " '\"Follow me and I will show you your room.\"',\n",
       " 'So Dorothy said good-bye to all her friends except Toto, and taking\\nthe dog in her arms followed the green girl through seven passages\\nand up three flights of stairs until they came to a room at the front\\nof the Palace. It was the sweetest little room in the world, with\\na soft, comfortable bed that had sheets of green silk and a green\\nvelvet counterpane. There was a tiny fountain in the middle of the\\nroom, that shot a spray of green perfume into the air, to fall back\\ninto a beautifully carved green marble basin. Beautiful green flowers\\nstood in the windows, and there was a shelf with a row of little\\ngreen books. When Dorothy had time to open these books she found them\\nfull of queer green pictures that made her laugh, they were so funny.',\n",
       " 'In a wardrobe were many green dresses, made of silk and satin and\\nvelvet; and all of them fitted Dorothy exactly.',\n",
       " '\"Make yourself perfectly at home,\" said the green girl, \"and if you\\nwish for anything ring the bell. Oz will send for you to-morrow\\nmorning.\"',\n",
       " 'She left Dorothy alone and went back to the others. These she also\\nled to rooms, and each one of them found himself lodged in a very\\npleasant part of the Palace. Of course this politeness was wasted on\\nthe Scarecrow; for when he found himself alone in his room he stood\\nstupidly in one spot, just within the doorway, to wait till morning.\\nIt would not rest him to lie down, and he could not close his eyes;\\nso he remained all night staring at a little spider which was weaving\\nits web in a corner of the room, just as if it were not one of the\\nmost wonderful rooms in the world. The Tin Woodman lay down on his\\nbed from force of habit, for he remembered when he was made of flesh;\\nbut not being able to sleep he passed the night moving his joints up\\nand down to make sure they kept in good working order. The Lion would\\nhave preferred a bed of dried leaves in the forest, and did not like\\nbeing shut up in a room; but he had too much sense to let this worry\\nhim, so he sprang upon the bed and rolled himself up like a cat and\\npurred himself asleep in a minute.',\n",
       " \"The next morning, after breakfast, the green maiden came to fetch\\nDorothy, and she dressed her in one of the prettiest gowns--made of\\ngreen brocaded satin. Dorothy put on a green silk apron and tied a\\ngreen ribbon around Toto's neck, and they started for the Throne Room\\nof the Great Oz.\",\n",
       " 'First they came to a great hall in which were many ladies and\\ngentlemen of the court, all dressed in rich costumes. These people\\nhad nothing to do but talk to each other, but they always came to\\nwait outside the Throne Room every morning, although they were never\\npermitted to see Oz. As Dorothy entered they looked at her curiously,\\nand one of them whispered,',\n",
       " '\"Are you really going to look upon the face of Oz the Terrible?\"',\n",
       " '\"Of course,\" answered the girl, \"if he will see me.\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, he will see you,\" said the soldier who had taken her message\\nto the Wizard, \"although he does not like to have people ask to see\\nhim. Indeed, at first he was angry, and said I should send you back\\nwhere you came from. Then he asked me what you looked like, and when\\nI mentioned your silver shoes he was very much interested. At last I\\ntold him about the mark upon your forehead, and he decided he would\\nadmit you to his presence.\"',\n",
       " 'Just then a bell rang, and the green girl said to Dorothy,',\n",
       " '\"That is the signal. You must go into the Throne Room alone.\"',\n",
       " 'She opened a little door and Dorothy walked boldly through and found\\nherself in a wonderful place. It was a big, round room with a high\\narched roof, and the walls and ceiling and floor were covered with\\nlarge emeralds set closely together.

       " 'But what interested Dorothy most was the big throne of green marble\\nthat stood in the middle of the room. It was shaped like a chair\\nand sparkled with gems, as did everything else. In the center of the\\nchair was an enormous Head, without body to support it or any arms or\\nlegs whatever. There was no hair upon this head, but it had eyes and\\nnose and mouth, and was bigger than the head of the biggest giant.',\n",
       " 'As Dorothy gazed upon this in wonder and fear the eyes turned slowly\\nand looked at her sharply and steadily. Then the mouth moved, and\\nDorothy heard a voice say:',\n",

       " '\"That is where the good Witch of the North kissed me when she bade me\\ngood-bye and sent me to you,\" said the girl.',\n",
       " 'Again the eyes looked at her sharply, and they saw she was telling\\nthe truth. Then Oz asked,',\n",
       " '\"What do you wish me to do?\"',\n",
       " '\"Send me back to Kansas, where my Aunt Em and Uncle Henry are,\" she\\nanswered, earnestly. \"I don\\'t like your country, although it is so\\nbeautiful. And I am sure Aunt Em will be dreadfully worried over my\\nbeing away so long.\"',\n",
       " 'The eyes winked three times, and then they turned up to the ceiling and\\ndown to the floor and rolled around so queerly that they seemed to see\\nevery part of the room. And at last they looked at Dorothy again.',\n",
       " '\"Why should I do this for you?\" asked Oz.',\n",

       " '\"But you were strong enough to kill the wicked Witch of the East,\"\\nsaid Oz.',\n",
       " '\"That just happened,\" returned Dorothy, simply; \"I could not help it.\"',\n",
       " '\"Well,\" said the Head, \"I will give you my answer. You have no right\\nto expect me to send you back to Kansas unless you do something for\\nme in return. In this country everyone must pay for everything he\\ngets. If you wish me to use my magic power to send you home again you\\nmust do something for me first. Help me and I will help you.\"',\n",
       " '\"What must I do?\" asked the girl.',\n",
       " '\"Kill the wicked Witch of the West,\" answered Oz.',\n",
       " '\"But I cannot!\" exclaimed Dorothy, greatly surprised.',\n",
       " '\"You killed the Witch of the East and you wear the silver shoes,\\nwhich bear a powerful charm. There is now but one Wicked Witch left\\nin all this land, and when you can tell me she is dead I will send\\nyou back to Kansas--but not before.\"',\n",
       " 'The little girl began to weep, she was so much disappointed; and the\\neyes winked again and looked upon her anxiously, as if the Great Oz\\nfelt that she could help him if she would.',\n",

       " '\"I do not know,\" said the Head; \"but that is my answer, and until the\\nWicked Witch dies you will not see your Uncle and Aunt again.

The Beast had a head\\nlike that of a rhinoceros, only there were five eyes in its face.\\nThere were five long arms growing out of its body and it also had\\nfive long, slim legs. Thick, woolly hair covered every part of it,\\nand a more dreadful looking monster could not be imagined. It was\\nfortunate the Tin Woodman had no heart at that moment, for it would\\nhave beat loud and fast from terror. But being only tin, the Woodman\\nwas not at all afraid, although he was much disappointed.',\n",

So the Wicked Witch laughed to herself, and\\nthought, \"I can still make her my slave, for she does not know how to\\nuse her power.\" Then she said to Dorothy, harshly and severely,',\n",
       " '\"Come with me; and see that you mind everything I tell you, for if\\nyou do not I will make an end of you, as I did of the Tin Woodman and\\nthe Scarecrow.\"',\n",
       " 'Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle\\nuntil they came to the kitchen, where the Witch bade her clean the pots\\nand kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.',\n",
       " 'Dorothy went to work meekly, with her mind made up to work as hard as\\nshe could; for she was glad the Wicked Witch had decided not to kill\\nher.',\n",
       " 'With Dorothy hard at work the Witch thought she would go into the\\ncourt-yard and harness the Cowardly Lion like a horse; it would amuse\\nher, she was sure, to make him draw her chariot whenever she wished\\nto go to drive. But as she opened the gate the Lion gave a loud roar\\nand bounded at her so fiercely that the Witch was afraid, and ran out\\nand shut the gate again.',\n",
       " '\"If I cannot harness you,\" said the Witch to the Lion, speaking\\nthrough the bars of the gate, \"I can starve you. You shall have\\nnothing to eat until you do as I wish.\"',\n",
       " 'So after that she took no food to the imprisoned Lion; but every day\\nshe came to the gate at noon and asked,',\n",
       " '\"Are you ready to be harnessed like a horse?\"',\n",
       " 'And the Lion would answer,',\n",
       " '\"No. If you come in this yard I will bite you.\"',\n",
       " 'The reason the Lion did not have to do as the Witch wished was that\\nevery night, while the woman was asleep Dorothy carried him food from\\nthe cupboard. After he had eaten he would lie down on his bed of straw,\\nand Dorothy would lie beside him and put her head on his soft, shaggy\\nmane, while they talked of their troubles and tried to plan some way to\\nescape. But they could find no way to get out of the castle, for it was\\nconstantly guarded by the yellow Winkies, who were the slaves of the\\nWicked Witch and too afraid of her not to do as she told them.',\n",
       " 'The girl had to work hard during the day, and often the Witch\\nthreatened to beat her with the same old umbrella she always carried in\\nher hand. But, in truth, she did not dare to strike Dorothy, because of\\nthe mark upon her forehead. The child did not know this, and was full\\nof fear for herself and Toto. Once the Witch struck Toto a blow with\\nher umbrella and the brave little dog flew at her and bit her leg, in\\nreturn. The Witch did not bleed where she was bitten, for she was so\\nwicked that the blood in her had dried up many years before.',\n",
       " \"Dorothy's life became very sad as she grew to understand that it\\nwould be harder than ever to get back to Kansas and Aunt Em again.\\nSometimes she would cry bitterly for hours, with Toto sitting at her\\nfeet and looking into her face, whining dismally to show how sorry he\\nwas for his little mistress. Toto did not really care whether he was\\nin Kansas or the Land of Oz so long as Dorothy was with him; but he\\nknew the little girl was unhappy, and that made him unhappy too.\",\n",
       " \"Now the Wicked Witch had a great longing to have for her own the\\nSilver Shoes which the girl always wore. Her Bees and her Crows and\\nher Wolves were lying in heaps and drying up, and she had used up\\nall the power of the Golden Cap; but if she could only get hold of\\nthe Silver Shoes they would give her more power than all the other\\nthings she had lost. She watched Dorothy carefully, to see if she\\never took off her shoes, thinking she might steal them. But the child\\nwas so proud of her pretty shoes that she never took them off except\\nat night and when she took her bath. The Witch was too much afraid\\nof the dark to dare go in Dorothy's room at night to take the shoes,\\nand her dread of water was greater than her fear of the dark, so she\\nnever came near when Dorothy was bathing. Indeed, the old Witch never\\ntouched water, nor ever let water touch her in any way.\",\n",
       " 'But the wicked creature was very cunning, and she finally thought of\\na trick that would give her what she wanted. She placed a bar of iron\\nin the middle of the kitchen floor, and then by her magic arts made\\nthe iron invisible to human eyes. So that when Dorothy walked across\\nthe floor she stumbled over the bar, not being able to see it, and\\nfell at full length. She was not much hurt, but in her fall one of\\nthe Silver Shoes came off, and before she could reach it the Witch\\nhad snatched it away and put it on her own skinny foot.',\n",
       " 'The wicked woman was greatly pleased with the success of her trick,\\nfor as long as she had one of the shoes she owned half the power of\\ntheir charm, and Dorothy could not use it against her, even had she\\nknown how to do so.',\n",
       " 'The little girl, seeing she had lost one of her pretty shoes, grew\\nangry, and said to the Witch,',\n",
       " '\"Give me back my shoe!\"',\n",
       " '\"I will not,\" retorted the Witch, \"for it is now my shoe, and not\\nyours.\"',\n",
       " '\"You are a wicked creature!\" cried Dorothy. \"You have no right to\\ntake my shoe from me.\"',\n",
       " '\"I shall keep it, just the same,\" said the Witch, laughing at her,\\n\"and some day I shall get the other one from you, too.\"',\n",
       " 'This made Dorothy so very angry that she picked up the bucket of\\nwater that stood near and dashed it over the Witch, wetting her from\\nhead to foot.',\n",
       " 'Instantly the wicked woman gave a loud cry of fear; and then, as\\nDorothy looked at her in wonder, the Witch began to shrink and fall\\naway.',\n",
       " '\"See what you have done!\" she screamed. \"In a minute I shall melt\\naway.\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m very sorry, indeed,\" said Dorothy, who was truly frightened to\\nsee the Witch actually melting away like brown sugar before her very\\neyes.',\n",
       " '\"Didn\\'t you know water would be the end of me?\" asked the Witch, in a\\nwailing, despairing voice.',\n",
       " '\"Of course not,\" answered Dorothy; \"how should I?\"',\n",
       " '\"Well, in a few minutes I shall be all melted, and you will have the\\ncastle to yourself. I have been wicked in my day, but I never thought\\na little girl like you would ever be able to melt me and end my\\nwicked deeds. Look out--here I go!\"',\n",
       " 'With these words the Witch fell down in a brown, melted, shapeless\\nmass and began to spread over the clean boards of the kitchen floor.\\nSeeing that she had really melted away to nothing, Dorothy drew\\nanother bucket of water and threw it over the mess. She then swept\\nit all out the door. After picking out the silver shoe, which was\\nall that was left of the old woman, she cleaned and dried it with a\\ncloth, and put it on her foot again. Then, being at last free to do\\nas she chose, she ran out to the court-yard to tell the Lion that the\\nWicked Witch of the West had come to an end, and that they were no\\nlonger prisoners in a strange land.',\n",
       " \"The Cowardly Lion was much pleased to hear that the Wicked Witch\\nhad been melted by a bucket of water, and Dorothy at once unlocked\\nthe gate of his prison and set him free. They went in together to\\nthe castle, where Dorothy's first act was to call all the Winkies\\ntogether and tell them that they were no longer slaves.\",\n",
       " 'There was great rejoicing among the yellow Winkies, for they had\\nbeen made to work hard during many years for the Wicked Witch, who\\nhad always treated them with great cruelty. They kept this day as\\na holiday, then and ever after, and spent the time in feasting and\\ndancing.',\n",
       " '\"If our friends, the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, were only with\\nus,\" said the Lion, \"I should be quite happy.\"',\n",
       " '\"Don\\'t you suppose we could rescue them?\" asked the girl, anxiously.',\n",
       " '\"We can try,\" answered the Lion.',\n",
       " 'So they called the yellow Winkies and asked them if they would help\\nto rescue their friends, and the Winkies said that they would be\\ndelighted to do all in their power for Dorothy, who had set them free\\nfrom bondage. So she chose a number of the Winkies who looked as if\\nthey knew the most, and they all started away. They travelled that\\nday and part of the next until they came to the rocky plain where the\\nTin Woodman lay, all battered and bent. His axe was near him, but the\\nblade was rusted and the handle broken off short.',\n",
       " 'The Winkies lifted him tenderly in their arms, and carried him back\\nto the yellow castle again, Dorothy shedding a few tears by the way\\nat the sad plight of her old friend, and the Lion looking sober and\\nsorry. When they reached the castle Dorothy said to the Winkies,',\n",
       " '\"Are any of your people tinsmiths?\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, yes; some of us are very good tinsmiths,\" they told her.',\n",

       " '\"Can you straighten out those dents in the Tin Woodman, and bend\\nhim back into shape again, and solder him together where he is\\nbroken?\"',\n",
       " 'The tinsmiths looked the Woodman over carefully and then answered\\nthat they thought they could mend him so he would be as good as ever.\\nSo they set to work in one of the big yellow rooms of the castle and\\nworked for three days and four nights, hammering and twisting and\\nbending and soldering and polishing and pounding at the legs and body\\nand head of the Tin Woodman, until at last he was straightened out into\\nhis old form, and his joints worked as well as ever. To be sure, there\\nwere several patches on him, but the tinsmiths did a good job, and as\\nthe Woodman was not a vain man he did not mind the patches at all.',\n",
       " \"When, at last, he walked into Dorothy's room and thanked her for\\nrescuing him, he was so pleased that he wept tears of joy, and\\nDorothy had to wipe every tear carefully from his face with her\\napron, so his joints would not be rusted. At the same time her own\\ntears fell thick and fast at the joy of meeting her old friend again,\\nand these tears did not need to be wiped away. As for the Lion, he\\nwiped his eyes so often with the tip of his tail that it became quite\\nwet, and he was obliged to go out into the court-yard and hold it in\\nthe sun till it dried.\",\n",
       " '\"If we only had the Scarecrow with us again,\" said the Tin Woodman,\\nwhen Dorothy had finished telling him everything that had happened,\\n\"I should be quite happy.\"',\n",
       " '\"We must try to find him,\" said the girl.',\n",
       " \"So she called the Winkies to help her, and they walked all that day\\nand part of the next until they came to the tall tree in the branches\\nof which the Winged Monkeys had tossed the Scarecrow's clothes.\",\n",
       " 'It was a very tall tree, and the trunk was so smooth that no one\\ncould climb it; but the Woodman said at once,',\n",

       " \"Now while the tinsmiths had been at work mending the Woodman himself,\\nanother of the Winkies, who was a goldsmith, had made an axe-handle\\nof solid gold and fitted it to the Woodman's axe, instead of the\\nold broken handle.

       " 'This they decided to do. The next day they called the Winkies together\\nand bade them good-bye. The Winkies were sorry to have them go, and\\nthey had grown so fond of the Tin Woodman that they begged him to stay\\nand rule over them and the Yellow Land of the West. Finding they were\\ndetermined to go, the Winkies gave Toto and the Lion each a golden\\ncollar; and to Dorothy they presented a beautiful bracelet, studded\\nwith diamonds; and to the Scarecrow they gave a gold-headed walking\\nstick, to keep him from stumbling; and to the Tin Woodman they offered\\na silver oil-can, inlaid with gold and set with precious jewels.',\n",

When the four\\ntravellers went in search of the Witch she had seen them coming, and\\nso sent the Winged Monkeys to bring them to her. It was much harder\\nto find their way back through the big fields of buttercups and\\nyellow daisies than it was being carried. They knew, of course, they\\nmust go straight east, toward the rising sun; and they started off\\nin the right way. But at noon, when the sun was over their heads,\\nthey did not know which was east and which was west, and that was\\nthe reason they were lost in the great fields. They kept on walking,\\nhowever, and at night the moon came out and shone brightly.

       " '\"Suppose we call the Field Mice,\" she suggested. \"They could probably\\ntell us the way to the Emerald City.\"',\n",

       " '\"What is your command?\"',\n",
       " '\"We wish to go to the Emerald City,\" said the child, \"and we have\\nlost our way.\"',\n",

Perhaps\\nsome of us were rather too full of mischief at times, flying down to\\npull the tails of the animals that had no wings, chasing birds, and\\nthrowing nuts at the people who walked in the forest. But we were\\ncareless and happy and full of fun, and enjoyed every minute of the\\nday. This was many years ago, long before Oz came out of the clouds\\nto rule over this land.',\n",

All her magic was used to help the\\npeople, and she was never known to hurt anyone who was good. Her name\\nwas Gayelette, and she lived in a handsome palace built from great\\nblocks of ruby. Everyone loved her, but her greatest sorrow was that\\nshe could find no one to love in return, since all the men were much\\ntoo stupid and ugly to mate with one so beautiful and wise. At last,\\nhowever, she found a boy who was handsome and manly and wise beyond\\nhis years. Gayelette made up her mind that when he grew to be a man\\nshe would make him her husband, so she took him to her ruby palace\\nand used all her magic powers to make him as strong and good and\\nlovely as any woman could wish. When he grew to manhood, Quelala,\\nas he was called, was said to be the best and wisest man in all the\\nland, while his manly beauty was so great that Gayelette loved him\\ndearly, and hastened to make everything ready for the wedding.',\n",
       " '\"My grandfather was at that time the King of the Winged Monkeys which\\nlived in the forest near Gayalette\\'s palace, and the old fellow loved\\na joke better than a good dinner. One day, just before the wedding,\\nmy grandfather was flying out with his band when he saw Quelala\\nwalking beside the river. He was dressed in a rich costume of pink\\nsilk and purple velvet, and my grandfather thought he would see what\\nhe could do. At his word the band flew down and seized Quelala,\\ncarried him in their arms until they were over the middle of the\\nriver, and then dropped him into the water.',\n",
       " '\"\\'Swim out, my fine fellow,\\'\" cried my grandfather, \"\\'and see if the\\nwater has spotted your clothes.\\'\" Quelala was much too wise not to\\nswim, and he was not in the least spoiled by all his good fortune. He\\nlaughed, when he came to the top of the water, and swam in to shore.\\nBut when Gayelette came running out to him she found his silks and\\nvelvet all ruined by the river.',\n",
       " '\"The princess was very angry, and she knew, of course, who did it. She\\nhad all the Winged Monkeys brought before her, and she said at first\\nthat their wings should be tied and they should be treated as they had\\ntreated Quelala, and dropped in the river. But my grandfather pleaded\\nhard, for he knew the Monkeys would drown in the river with their wings\\ntied, and Quelala said a kind word for them also; so that Gayelette\\nfinally spared them, on condition that the Winged Monkeys should ever\\nafter do three times the bidding of the owner of the Golden Cap. This\\nCap had been made for a wedding present to Quelala, and it is said to\\nhave cost the princess half her kingdom. Of course my grandfather and\\nall the other Monkeys at once agreed to the condition, and that is\\nhow it happens that we are three times the slaves of the owner of the\\nGolden Cap, whomsoever he may be.\"',\n",

       " 'The four travellers passed a sleepless night, each thinking of the\\ngift Oz had promised to bestow upon him. Dorothy fell asleep only\\nonce, and then she dreamed she was in Kansas, where Aunt Em was\\ntelling her how glad she was to have her little girl at home again.',\n",
       " \"Promptly at nine o'clock the next morning the green whiskered soldier\\ncame to them, and four minutes later they all went into the Throne\\nRoom of the Great Oz.\",\n",

       " '\"Yes,\" she answered, \"I melted her with a bucket of water.\"',\n",
       " '\"Dear me,\" said the Voice; \"how sudden! Well, come to me to-morrow,\\nfor I must have time to think it over.\"',\n",
       " '\"You\\'ve had plenty of time already,\" said the Tin Woodman, angrily.',\n",
       " '\"We shan\\'t wait a day longer,\" said the Scarecrow.',\n",

       " 'The Lion thought it might be as well to frighten the Wizard, so\\nhe gave a large, loud roar, which was so fierce and dreadful that\\nToto jumped away from him in alarm and tipped over the screen that\\nstood in a corner. As it fell with a crash they looked that way,\\nand the next moment all of them were filled with wonder. For they\\nsaw, standing in just the spot the screen had hidden, a little, old\\nman, with a bald head and a wrinkled face, who seemed to be as much\\nsurprised as they were. The Tin Woodman, raising his axe, rushed\\ntoward the little man and cried out,',\n",

       " '\"My dear friends,\" said Oz, \"I pray you not to speak of these\\nlittle things. Think of me, and the terrible trouble I\\'m in at being\\nfound out.\"',\n",
       " '\"Doesn\\'t anyone else know you\\'re a humbug?\" asked Dorothy.',\n",
       " '\"No one knows it but you four--and myself,\" replied Oz. \"I have\\nfooled everyone so long that I thought I should never be found out.\\nIt was a great mistake my ever letting you into the Throne Room.\\nUsually I will not see even my subjects, and so they believe I am\\nsomething terrible.\"',\n",
       " '\"But, I don\\'t understand,\" said Dorothy, in bewilderment. \"How was it\\nthat you appeared to me as a great Head?\"',\n",
       " '\"That was one of my tricks,\" answered Oz. \"Step this way, please, and\\nI will tell you all about it.\"',\n",
       " 'He led the way to a small chamber in the rear of the Throne Room,\\nand they all followed him. He pointed to one corner, in which lay\\nthe Great Head, made out of many thicknesses of paper, and with a\\ncarefully painted face.',\n",

       " '\"Oh, I am a ventriloquist,\" said the little man, \"and I can throw\\nthe sound of my voice wherever I wish; so that you thought it was\\ncoming out of the Head. Here are the other things I used to deceive\\nyou.\" He showed the Scarecrow the dress and the mask he had worn when\\nhe seemed to be the lovely Lady; and the Tin Woodman saw that his\\nTerrible Beast was nothing but a lot of skins, sewn together, with\\nslats to keep their sides out. As for the Ball of Fire, the false\\nWizard had hung that also from the ceiling. It was really a ball of\\ncotton, but when oil was poured upon it the ball burned fiercely.',\n",
       " '\"Really,\" said the Scarecrow, \"you ought to be ashamed of yourself\\nfor being such a humbug.\"',\n",

       " '\"No; but it\\'s farther from here,\" he said, shaking his head at her,\\nsadly. \"When I grew up I became a ventriloquist, and at that I was\\nvery well trained by a great master. I can imitate any kind of a\\nbird or beast.\" Here he mewed so like a kitten that Toto pricked up\\nhis ears and looked everywhere to see where she was. \"After a time,\"\\ncontinued Oz, \"I tired of that, and became a balloonist.\"',\n",

       " '\"A man who goes up in a balloon on circus day, so as to draw a crowd\\nof people together and get them to pay to see the circus,\" he explained.',\n",
       " '\"Oh,\" she said; \"I know.\"',\n",
       " '\"Well, one day I went up in a balloon and the ropes got twisted, so\\nthat I couldn\\'t come down again. It went way up above the clouds, so\\nfar that a current of air struck it and carried it many, many miles\\naway. For a day and a night I travelled through the air, and on the\\nmorning of the second day I awoke and found the balloon floating over\\na strange and beautiful country.',\n",
       " '\"It came down gradually, and I was not hurt a bit. But I found myself\\nin the midst of a strange people, who, seeing me come from the clouds,\\nthought I was a great Wizard. Of course I let them think so, because\\nthey were afraid of me, and promised to do anything I wished them to.',\n",
       " '\"Just to amuse myself, and keep the good people busy, I ordered them to\\nbuild this City, and my palace; and they did it all willingly and well.\\nThen I thought, as the country was so green and beautiful, I would\\ncall it the Emerald City, and to make the name fit better I put green\\nspectacles on all the people, so that everything they saw was green.\"',\n",
       " '\"But isn\\'t everything here green?\" asked Dorothy.',\n",
       " '\"No more than in any other city,\" replied Oz; \"but when you wear\\ngreen spectacles, why of course everything you see looks green to\\nyou. The Emerald City was built a great many years ago, for I was a\\nyoung man when the balloon brought me here, and I am a very old man\\nnow. But my people have worn green glasses on their eyes so long that\\nmost of them think it really is an Emerald City, and it certainly is\\na beautiful place, abounding in jewels and precious metals, and every\\ngood thing that is needed to make one happy. I have been good to the\\npeople, and they like me; but ever since this Palace was built I have\\nshut myself up and would not see any of them.',\n",
       " '\"One of my greatest fears was the Witches, for while I had no magical\\npowers at all I soon found out that the Witches were really able to\\ndo wonderful things. There were four of them in this country, and\\nthey ruled the people who live in the North and South and East and\\nWest. Fortunately, the Witches of the North and South were good, and\\nI knew they would do me no harm; but the Witches of the East and West\\nwere terribly wicked, and had they not thought I was more powerful\\nthan they themselves, they would surely have destroyed me. As it was,\\nI lived in deadly fear of them for many years; so you can imagine how\\npleased I was when I heard your house had fallen on the Wicked Witch\\nof the East. When you came to me I was willing to promise anything if\\nyou would only do away with the other Witch; but, now that you have\\nmelted her, I am ashamed to say that I cannot keep my promises.\"',\n",
       " '\"I think you are a very bad man,\" said Dorothy.',\n",

       " '\"How can I get to her castle?\" asked Dorothy.',\n",
       " '\"The road is straight to the South,\" he answered, \"but it is said to be\\nfull of dangers to travellers.

       " '\"Certainly. If it wasn\\'t for Dorothy I should never have had brains.\\nShe lifted me from the pole in the cornfield and brought me to the\\nEmerald City. So my good luck is all due to her, and I shall never\\nleave her until she starts back to Kansas for good and all.\"',\n",
       " '\"Thank you,\" said Dorothy, gratefully. \"You are all very kind to me.\\nBut I should like to start as soon as possible.\"',\n",

But he at once unlocked their\\nspectacles, which he put back into the green box, and gave them many\\ngood wishes to carry with them.',\n",
       " '\"You are now our ruler,\" he said to the Scarecrow; \"so you must come\\nback to us as soon as possible.\"',\n",

There\\nwas no way of going around it, for it seemed to extend to the right and\\nleft as far as they could see; and, besides, they did not dare change\\nthe direction of their journey for fear of getting lost.

When a big branch bent down to seize him the\\nWoodman chopped at it so fiercely that he cut it in two. At once\\nthe tree began shaking all its branches as if in pain, and the Tin\\nWoodman passed safely under it.',\n",
       " '\"Come on!\" he shouted to the others; \"be quick!\"',\n",

       " 'The four travellers walked with ease through the trees until they came\\nto the further edge of the wood. Then, to their surprise, they found\\nbefore them a high wall, which seemed to be made of white china. It was\\nsmooth, like the surface of a dish, and higher than their heads.',\n",
