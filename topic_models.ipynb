If the dealer profit is $1000, then you would only be paying $12k for the same car. So isn't that saving money? Moreover, if Saturn really does reduce the dealer profit margin by $1000, then their cars will be even better deals. Say, if the price of a Saturn was already $1000 below market average for the class of cars, then after they reduce the dealer profit, it would be $2000 below market average. It will: 1) Attract even more people to buy Saturns because it would SAVE THEM MONEY. 2) Force the competitors to lower their prices to survive. Now, not only will Saturn owners benefit from a lower dealer profit, even the buyers for other cars will pay less. Isn't that saving money? $0.02, doug.\",\n",

Whoa. Bad repair record). And all of these cars are driven fairly hard. None of them are at the head of a line of cars going 30 MPH....the first two spend a lot of their operating life with the speedometer pegged...and the only reason the 84 doesn't is it has a 120 MPH speedo...

I see lots of Honda's and Toyota's. 2) There is a special deal where I can get an Infinity G20, fully loaded, at dealer cost (I have check this out and the numbers match up). They are doing this because they are releasing and update mid-1993 version (includes dual air-bags) and want to get rid of their old 1993's. I guess my question is: Is this a good deal?

The earlier cars (pre 74-1/2) are usually more desirable due to certain things that went with having chrome bumpers (ride height, generally more power). The older cars are appreciating... slowly. The newer ones seem to be at a stable level at the moment. $6 to $8k would require extremely good condition and low miles. If the car is in good shape and regular maintenance is kept up on it, the car should last for a long time. There are still plenty of parts sources ouththere. The MGB is a great, fun little car. If she is keeping it solely in the hopes that it is going to appreciate, tell her to sell it. It is not worth waiting the time it would take to appreciate to a real profitable level. *************************************************************************** *Rick Guynn -MG driver soontobe. * MGA 1600 MkII * *RCG1597@zeus.tamu.edu * Rebuild (complete) to be finished ?? * *Texas A&M University * * *Keeper of the eternal octagon * `69 MGB Roadster * * a.k.a.

It's not biology at all, it's clothing design. Women's clothing is generally designed to be as non-functional as possible. It's only been in the last five years or so that you could buy women's pants with pockets deep enough to carry anything in. Previously, deep pockets were virtually unknown in women's clothing. Skirts generally have better pockets now, too. Dresses, espcially fancy dresses, are still pretty hopeless. I often hand my driver's license over to my husband if we're dressed up to go out somewhere, so I don't have to be encumbered by a purse. If women consistently bought functional clothing, and boycotted the manufacturers who refuse to make functional women's clothing, I think manufacturers would tend to bow to market pressures. There's an interesting chapter in Susan Faludi's Backlash that described what happened the LAST time clothing manufacturers ignored the need for functional women's clothing.

I don't happen to have my SAE manual handy, but oil viscosity in general _decreases_ with temperature. The SAE numbers are based on a `typical' curve that oils used to all have, running from (say) the viscosity of a room-temperature 90-weight at 0C, down to (say) that of a room-temperature 5-weight at 20C, for a typical 40-weight oil. Oils that are designed for operation in `normal' temperatures just have a weight specification. Oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly cold temperatures have a `W' tacked on the end, so in winter in a cold place, you'd stick 10W in your car in the winter and 40 in it in the summer, to approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year. Modern multi-viscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature. As a result, their viscosity graphs cross over several curves. A multi-vis specification pegs the curve at two temperatures, a `normal' operating temperature and a `cold' one (though I can't remember the numbers...). In any event, the weights do indicate a significant difference. Remember that your engine is temperature-regulated (by the thermostat and radiator or air fins) most of the time -- unless you overheat it or something. Any weight of oil is better than no oil, or than very old, carbonized oil. Thin oil won't (in general) lubricate as well at temperature, thicker oil will (like a 20W50) will lubricate better at temperature, but not as well during startup, when most engine wear occurs. If you're planning on making long drives, the 20W50 is probably fine (esp. in the summer) in your 10W40 car. But if you're making short drives, stick to the 10W40. -- DON'T DRINK SOAP! DILUTE DILUTE!

By the 1920s, there was a very active \"good roads\" movement, which had its origins actually in the 1890s during the bicycle craze, picked up steam in the teens (witness the Linclon Highway Association, 1912 or so, and the US highway support act (real name: something different) in 1916 that first pledged federal aid to states and counties to build decent roads. Also, the experience of widespread use of trucks for domestic transport during WW 1 convinced the government that good raods were crucial to our national defense. Anyway, by the 20s there were plenty of good roads, at least around urban areas, and they were rapidly expanding into the countryside. This was the era, after all, of the first auto touring fad, the motel, the auto camp ground, etc. Two good books on the subject spring to mind - Warren Belasco \"America on the Road\" (title may not be exact - author is) and another called \"The Devil Wagon in God\\'s Country\" author I forget. Also, any of John Flink\\'s or John Bell Rae\\'s auto histories. As to placement of the steering wheel being arbitrary, by the early teens there were virtually no American cars that did not have the wheel on the left. In the early days, cars had the wheel on the left, on the right, and even in the middle, as well as sometimes having a tiller instead of a wheel.

So isn\\'t that saving money? Yes. But the point is that prices are competetive. Saturn may well be selling a car intended on giving the dealer a $2000 profit, but since a comperable Honda with $500 profit is more expensive, it may be well worth it to buy the Saturn. >Moreover, if Saturn really does reduce the dealer profit margin by $1000, >then their cars will be even better deals.

Not necessarily. It seems to me that Saturn salesdroids, who don\\'t make a commision, whereas their counterparts at other dealerships generally do, make more $$ per hour or whatever. This means that Saturn doesn\\'t give up the profit to their employees through commision, which IS taken out of per- car profits.

I may be wrong, but a loaded Tarus beats a Saturn SL2. I agree that a fully-loaded SL2 would come close in price to a LOWER-END Ford Taurus. A FULLY-LOADED Taurus, on the other hand, would still be substantially more expensive than even the most glitzy SL2. A fully loaded SL2 would run somewhere around $17,000, while a fully loaded Taurus LX would be somewhere around the $22,000-$23,000 range. A base Taurus (GL I believe) might start around $15,000. Of course there is the Taurus SHO which can push $30,000 if you really try, but this is a totally different car than your mainstream Taurus sedan.

It looks like Volvo uses something like \"Do you dare to risk your family in any car?\" attitude, which is quite annoying in the long run. But now Volvo has produced a new good car, the Volvo 850.

Only problem is when you get into accident(it doesn\\'t usually break down unless you forget to get a oil change for 30000 miles or something stupid like this), body parts and other parts are very hard to locate. Parts are over priced also. One of my friend had accident in past snow storm and he is still waiting for front bumper and passenger side fender. Well, if you test drive Land Cruiser, all other SUV look like toys. One of magazine writer called it \"Land Bruiser\". If you have $40,000 to spare for SUV, get Land Cruiser and forget Lange Rover. --Sang',\n",

In the early 80\\'s with the fuel crisis, etc., everyone wanted better fuel mileage. Diesel fuel was the cheapest fuel available and usually provides better mileage than comparable gasoline engines. So, GM decided to conver their 350 gas engine into a diesel engine (I think was a 5.7 liter). Big mistake. The engine was not redesigned, but converted. The engine could not handle the higher compression, etc. Lots of problems with these cars. This thew up a big red flag to the casual observer -- DON\"T BUY A DIESEL. THEY ARE BAD. This was a gross generalization. Ask yourself this question -- if your livelihood depended on driving, LOTS of it, would you use a dependable or undependable (but cheaper in the short run) vehicle? What do Greyhound busses have in them? Trailer Trucks? Even Train Locomotives? Are these gasoline engines? No, they are diesel. Tractor trailer truck manufacturers provide a 500,000 mile warrantee with they vehicles. I own an `82 Diesel Suburban. The 6.2L diesel is a GREAT engine. Just keeps going. It was more expensive (when new) than the gasoline engine vehicle was. The only problem with diesel engines is that when they need to be rebuilt, they are expensive. In a gas 350 engine, you will pay about $1000 for a rebuild. Diesel 6.2L is about $2000. But then again, the diesel engine lasts about twice as long and gets about 50% better mileage. A carburator for a gasoline engine costs about $100 to rebuild (or less). A rebuild of the fuel injection pump on a diesel will cost about $500 (or more). But then again, you never need a tune-up. If you\\'re looking at a rebuilt 6.2L, I\\'d say you got a great deal. Check to see if the fuel injection pump was rebuilt also. Good luck.',\n",

Go to KMart and buy the > cleaner yourself for $1.29. This should not be the case if they are at all reputable. Fuel injector cleaning is done properly with a can of injector cleaner solvent which is hooked up to the fuel system under high pressure. The car is actually run on the solvent during the cleaning process. The equipment to properly do this is pricey, and generally not something the average home mechanic has. The solvent itself is not very expensive ($5-$8) and you could probably make up a hose to fit your system and do it yourself, but I didn\\'t tell you that... :-) Not many in-tank cleaners are worth wasting your money on. There has been a discussion of these products on here from time to time, and Chevron Techron (not Pro-Gard with Techron) is generally regarded as the best. It is, however, a bit more than $1.29 a bottle. IMHO, it will not substitute for proper injector cleaning if they are really crudded up. You\\'ll have to decide if the $59 price is a better deal than spending your time and/or buying equipment to do it. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Scott Keller +1 314 537 6317 The Agricultural Group of Monsanto Company sekell@bb1t.monsanto.com KA0WCH packet: ka0wch@k0pfx.mo.usa.na',\n",

       " 'I know it\\'s a long shot, but maybe someone went through this and will have some comments to share. The story is this: I bought a car out of state, and I\\'m trying to get the safety inspection in Pennsylvania. The problem is that the car has aftermarket tint on all windows except the windshield. The tint is rather weak, and you can clearly see the inside of the car through the tint. The inspection garage said that they won\\'t pass it unless I get a waiver from the state police. So I went to the state police - the officer told me that aftermarket tint is illegal, and I can get a waiver only for a pre-84 car or for a medical reason. I asked him to show me the section of the vehicle code that says it\\'s illegal. He showed it to me and the paraghaph said that you can\\'t have tint, if you can\\'t see the inside of the car because of the tint. When I told him that you can in fact see the inside very well, he shut the book and said \"It\\'s just illegal, and in fact we can have someone give you a ticket for it right now.\" Well, won\\'t argue with that... Since the vehicle code says it\\'s OK as long as you can see through the tint, I\\'d like to keep it (I\\'ll re-read the vehicle code in the library). I\\'d also like to get some sort of paper from the police that says it\\'s OK, so I can get the inspection, and so that I won\\'t get in trouble for the tint later on. I also wouldn\\'t mind registering a complaint against that officer - he really pissed me off. So does anyone have any experience getting that sort of a paper from the police, especially in Pennsylvania? Does anyone have any experience registering a complaint against an officer? I called the station later on today, but they basically said there is no place where I could register a complaint against an officer... And if I do decide to keep the tint and get a ticket anyway, how much of a chance do I stand to succesfully appeal the ticket in court? Any comments about it will be welcome! Michal',\n",

In fact, >it doesn\\'t mean *anything*, because the units are screwy. I agree and disagree. John is saying that the batters efforts will result in 4 more wins then losses. While you are probably correct that 400% does not mean 4 more wins then losses, it means something. I would rather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 1% in each of 400 PAs then I would a player who increased my chances of winning by .5% in each of 400 PAs. Thus, there appears to me to be an obvious positive association between John\\'s statistic and winning games. Thus, before you disregard this stat, it appears to me that further study must go into what sort of relationship there is. >Consider an example: Bob hits a 2-out solo HR in the bottom of the first; >about .12 on your scale.

So Fred and Bob combined have >amassed 138% of a win IN ONE GAME. There\\'s clearly a problem here. The only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly how many wins the team has. First, we are using averages over many seasons and applying them to one game. Second, remember some players performance take away from the chance of you winning. That is a player who gets an out gets a \"negative probability\" in most cases. Thus, I\\'m not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers for a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game. Sometimes, they will add up to more then one sometime, less than one. Also, the pitchers\\' bad performances (giving up 6 runs) may have given them a large negative percentage for that game. Also, any batter that pulled an 0-4 night would give large negatives. >>Greg thinking about the right things, but his intuition is off the >>mark. Closers are enormously important. The total number of runs >>value is outweighed by when they come, or are prevented from comming. >>The doubling which Greg allows is not enough. > >In another article, I proposed a test of this.

If >late runs are really more important than early runs, then looking only at >late runs should lead to a *better* predictor, right? No, but really only because you have a smaller sample size. I would think however, that the number of runs you score in the first inning would be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score in the last inning. And, realize something else a closer usually comes in in a close situation, not a blow out. It is hard to argue that any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance to those given up in the first inning. Look, a closer giving up runs often means a team will lose many games. On, the other hand a starter who gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win. The offence has many more outs to do something about. But, I am not saying all late inning situations are equally important either. If I am down 8 runs in the ninth, it really does not matter how many runs my pitcher gives up in the ninth. >Here\\'s another thought experiment: apply this method to basketball. What >you find is that points scored in the first *half* of the game have almost >exactly no value, because no lead is safe with an entire half yet to play. >Furthermore, the sub in off the bench who sinks the winning free throws with >no time on the clock gets a +1.0 for the game, while the star forward who >scored 27 points in the first half before spraining his ankle gets a zero. > >Does this make sense? No, but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would be 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made. Look, if you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left, there is a fairly high probability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the ball. And, do not forget that somebody elses missed shots, turnovers, fouls, bad defense, etc. caused a \"negative chance\" that the team would win. From reading all of the discussion on this statistic, I feel that those who critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda. At first look this statistic valadates clutchness. But, it really does not. Cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players in crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance goes down. I\\'ve never seen convincing proof that this really happens. So, if you assume there is no clutchness, then that means that except for a lot of noice, this statistic has a positive association to player performance. There is a way to get rid of the noice if you do not believe in clutchness. Certainly, we could find out what the average value of a home run is for example. We may find for instance, that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15% on average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5%. I bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just as good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses. How do we evaluate relief pitchers? Say John and Sam have the exact same pitching statistics (runs, earned runs, K\\'s, BB\\'s, etc.) Both had exceptional numbers. John, however only pitched in closer situations, while Sam was a Mop up man. Who was more valuble to their team? Probably John. Who was the better pitcher? They were probably about the same.

Women\\'s pants rarely have pockets and most, when they do, are too shallow to use! I is very important for a woman to have her keys in her hand when she goes from building to a car.

Ok, here\\'s what I understand: The SL/SL1/SL2/SW1/SW2 was meant to compete with the following cars: Honda Civic Toyota Tercel (SL,SL1) Toyota Corolla (SL1,SL2) Nissan Sentra Mazda 323/Protoge\\' Subaru Loyale/Impreza Isuzu Stylus Geo Prizm Ford Escort Mercury Tracer Mistubishi Mirage Plymouth/Dodge Colt Their core competition is the Civic, Corolla, and Sentra. Most of the other models are in the same class, but aren\\'t the first cars you would think of. I threw in the Escort/Tracer because it has a good amount of Japanese technology and has similar reliability stats. I didn\\'t include domestic small cars such as the Cavalier, Sunbird, Shadow, Sundance, Tempo, and Topaz, since I think Saturn is going after cars that have at least some degree of Japanese roots. The SC1/SC2 was meant to compete against the following cars: Toyota Paseo Honda Civic Si/Civic Coupes/del Sol Si Nissan NX1600/NX2000 Mazda MX-3 Isuzu Impulse Geo Storm Ford Escort GT If you look at the prices of these cars, they\\'re more expensive than they\\'re 4-door counterparts. The is good reason for this. It is a more upscale and trend-driven market. Even though many of these models are based on sedan platforms, their interior, etc. is good enough to warrant slightly higher prices. Here are some of the platform derivations I can think of: Tercel -> Paseo Sentra -> NX1600/NX2000 Civic -> del Sol 323 -> MX-3 (not sure on this one) Stylus -> Impulse/Storm To illustrate, a Tercel starts at around $8000, while the Paseo starts at around $11,000. Even a 4-door Tercel will cost less than a 2-door Paseo. Now, you might be saying that the Tercel doesn\\'t offer the power that some 4-doors offer. What I mean is that there is no 4-dr Tercel with a comparable powerplant as its sport coupe derivative. Let\\'s take another example: the Isuzu Stylus XS and Impulse XS/Storm GSi. Both have the same powerplants (a 1.6L 140hp engine), but the smaller 2-dr coupes are generally more expensive. Again, this is because the two-door sport coupe market is a more fashion-oriented and trend-setting segment. People are willing to pay more money for this type of car. In short, even though the SC1/SC2 may be smaller, hence \"less\" car, it\\'s market orientation dictates a slightly higher price than its mechanically equivalent sedan (SL1/SL2) version. I hope this clears things up a bit...... Mihir Shah',\n",

The worst that happens is that your tires wear oddly (well, you could have the wheels aiming TOTALLY pigeon toed and not be able to steer the car, raise your hands those that think their vision is so poor that they would screw up this badly!) I bet you are one of those people that feels that honing a cylinder wall with sand paper will kill millions of people. It aint magic. Go take the certification course, and look at the people that have never learned to add in their whole life that are taking the certification! BTW, I am disgusted at the Colt (and some of the other Chrysler offerings) because they go out of alignment if you sneaze at them. My '84 Chrysler Laser (Similar to the Daytona, a reskinned Colt) needed a realignment every 3 months ... Bolt a good grade 12' 2x4 to each wheel, using a carefully welded spacer jig. Measure toe in, adjust to manufacturer specs. Camber a bit more difficult to adjust and measure ... I used a micrometer to measure the space between the rim and a funky bent up pipe that could be placed on upper and lower portions of the rim on the inside of wheel (hard to explain). This same tool could be used instead of the 2x4s. I had made these tools up *right* after the last alignment done professionally so I had a reference that the original poster might not ...

       " 'Philadelphia at Chicago: Teams tied for 1st after Sunday Dick Redding battled Chet Brewer in the first game of a dramatic four game series. One Friday, one Saturday, and a good-old Sunday doubleheader. \"What could be better,\" declared Ernie Banks. Perhaps the fact that the Cubs are challenging? \"It\\'s pitching, it\\'s always been pitching that we\\'ve lacked,\" announced Ryne Sandberg. \"If we can get by Brewer, then beat Carlton, Alexander, or Bunning - preferrably 2 of the last three - we\\'ll know we might be able to win. \"Lord, I hope we pull it off.\" The Phils scored once in the top of the first; Richie Ashburn singled, Pete Rose followed with a hit, sending Ashburn around second. Kiki Cuyler cut the ball off in left center, and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks, who threw to Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third. Rose went to second on the play. Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center, moving Pete Rose to third. Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let him beat them. Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks this year. Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well, and he lashed a double into a gap in right-center. \"Cool Papa\" Bell\\'s speed allowed him to cut the ball off and prevent Schmidt from scoring. Nellie Fox was walked, and Bob Boone grounded out to second, ending the threat. \"Teams are starting to realize that you don\\'t have to pitch to Schmidt or Torrienti, and that is lowering their run total. It puts a lot of pressure on Klein and Dick Allen (who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spells Rose at first), and it\\'s a credit to the Phillies that they\\'ve been able to sustain their pace. The picthers have slumped at times.\" So came the analysis from Frank Chance. The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit, Thomas\\' grounder moved him to second, and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singled home a run. In the sixth, Ron Santo launched a two-run homer to make it 3-1. Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth, as Schmidt singled and Klein singled him to third. Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox, but Dick Allen popped out of the dugout to hit. Allen doubled to right, but luckily for the Cubs, Williams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense. He fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third. Lance Parrish, hitting for Boone, was walked, and Bruce Sutter entered. Larry Bowa grounded into a 1-2-3 double play, but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch-hitter. Desiring a strikeout, since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick Trillo pinch-running at third, Chance brought in Lee Smith, who induced a pop-up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder, ending the inning. The Cubs took the win, 3-2, moving a game behind the Phillies. Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3-Finger Brown Saturday. To get another righthander in the lineup, Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlock played third. Unfortunately, Brown allowed six doubles, and the Cub bullpen was worn down even more, as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead against Lefty. Madlock, batting sixth, had knocked two doubles of his own, driving home four runs. Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs, and Cuyler added another, and the score was 8-6, Cubs after six innings. The Phillie bullpen had more troubles in the bottom of the eighth, as the Cubs grabbed 3 more runs to ice an 11-7 triumph. Sunday\\'s twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at one point, including a rare outside-the-park home run in the second game, off Robin Roberts. Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest, 4-2, but the Cubs captured the second one 5-4, with Waddell gaining the win. Bruce Sutter tossed two innings for the save, though he allowed one run in the eighth. The Cardinals stood half a game behind these co-leaders, and would conclude their series with the Expos on Monday. ------------------------------------------------------------------- Montreal at St. Louis(August 3-6): 3-way tie for 1st Dennis Martinez is on a roll, and he continued it versus John Tudor Friday. The Expos have a wide variety of hitters, and - while they aren\\'t among the all-time greats, they are getting the job done. After winning their first first two games, they suddenly found themselves only 2 1/2 games out of first in this wacky season. Martinez triumphed 5-3 on Friday, and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean 3-2 Saturday. However, the Cardinals refused to give up, winning 6-2 on Sunday. The Cards captured Monday\\'s game, too, as Steve Carlton outdueled Steve Rogers 3-2. \"We\\'re really good against ground ball pitchers because of our team speed,\" remarked Lou Brock. \"I don\\'t see why we can\\'t win this division.\" The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for them. Two-thirds of the way through the season, there is a 3-way tie for first. ------------------------------------------------------------------- New York at Pittsburgh(August 3-6): 3 straight 3-2 wins for Bucs, now 2 back - but in 4th! \"When your team is in a slump like we are, the worst thing is to play in a pitcher\\'s park like this,\" spoke Gil Hodges before the series. Keith Hernandez added that \"their defense takes away quite a few runs per year, and it must be giving them an extra 6-7 wins.\" The Pirates have made only 26 errors all season, 6 ahead of the second place Dodgers. Error totals tend to be around 50 for the best defensive All-Time teams. Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez 5-2 Friday, and Candelaria outshone Seaver 3-2 Saturday, in a game featuring some outstanding defense. When Nolan Ryan and two relivers 6-hit the Mets in another 3-2 win Sunday, the Pirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the .500 mark. They had been unable to several times in the past month. Bert Blyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game. Both pitchers possessed fantastic stuff, and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home runs - a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two-run blast by Ralph Kiner for the Pirates. The Mets\\' Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in the top of the ninth off Jesse Orosco, working his second inning, after Mookie Wilson pinch-ran for Gary Carter at second. With one out and a runner on first, Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch-hit. The Pirates countered with Kent Tekulve, placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds in left field as the ninth place hitter. Tekulve induced a groundout forcing Strawberry at second. He slid hard into Honus Wagner, preventing the Pirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon. Tekulve allowed a hit, but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the right field line, ending the inning. Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers, who entered to pitch the eighth, and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deep center, running through the stop sign at third to score an inside-the-park homer to win. The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3-2 wins, and had moved to within 2 games of first place, with seven weeks to go. ------------------------------------------------------------------ San Francisco at Boswaukta(August 3-5): Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule, as the Giants managed to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting pitching that just wouldn\\'t tire. In fact, reported manager John McGraw, \"once this rough part of the schedule is over, maybe as early as this coming week, we may shift to a 4-man rotation again for a little while.\" Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday, beating Lew Burdette and the Braves 4-1. Willie Mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits. Rick Reuschel faced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest. The Braves\\' park had been a homer haven, but this took the cake, as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16-13. Willie Mays had three homers, Willie McCovey, Eddie Matthews, and Don Baylor had two, and Hank Aaron, Ernie Lombardi, Biz Mackey, and Mel Ott had one each. The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sunday\\'s doubleheader, putting them on a pace for 223, which would be 4 short of the National League record. They were still a tad behind the \\'61 Yankees\\' pace. They had allowed over 120, though. Vida Blue actually got the win after retiring 2 batters in the fifth. He allowed only a run in the sixth, but faltered in the seventh. Joe McGinnity earned the save. In the doubleheader, the Braves\\' Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the first game, but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as the Braves won, 4-3. The Giants took the second game, however, by a 6-2 score. The homer by Aaron was a magical #150 by the Braves; however, they fell to three game below .500, making a comeback extremely unlikely. ------------------------------------------------------------------- San Diego at Cincinnati(Aug. 3-5): Randy Jones faced Ewell Blackwell in the first of this 3-game series, and the Padres felt rather good. With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game, the trade looked even better. McGriff\\'s batting average was even rising. Of course, the bench was very poor, and Joe Gordon was only adequate in the outfield, but these were minor problems, since the pitching was holding up. Jones pitched a good game Friday, and won 6-3. McGriff launched two home runs. Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and Ray Narleski Saturday; 5-4 was the final score. Tom Candiotti battled Satchel Paige to a 3-3 tie through eight innings before departing. The game was scoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth. Paige had departed after 10, and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning. Tom Browning was working his second scoreless inning, when Dave Winfield doubled with one out and Joe Gordon was pitched around. Thurm Munson doubled both runners home, and the Padres gamed a 5-3 win. The three-game sweep had pulled the Giants into a tie with the Reds. Though the Reds denied it, the highly emotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them. ------------------------------------------------------------------- Brookangeles at Houston(August 3-5): Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the wide open plains of the Astrodome. The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill in the first game, opposite Don Drysdale. \"Normally,\" Drysdale remarked, \"I would be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them. I can\\'t afford to with this team, though; we have to get our own runners going; we can\\'t afford to let the Astros beat us.\" He then winked and said: \"Well, maybe Davis will get decked once.\" The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six (!) is primarily why he would be decked, but it should be understood that his current pace would give him nine for the season. The hitting on this team is a little better, but the power is all doubles and triples. Still, Carl Furillo is the main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend, as he threw two runners out trying for inside-the-park homers. For those unaware of the nastness of the Astros\\' park, they have a 23-foot high gray wall all around the outfield; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs. The foul poles are 355 feet from home plate, but the alleys are 400 feet away, with center field at 420 feet. \"It\\'s as if some three-year-old threw a tantrum and told his playmates: \\'If I can\\'t hit home runs, nobody will hit home runs\\',\" remarked Roy Campanella. The Dodgers stole five bases Friday, but the Astros decided to revitalize the Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before; for tonight, anyway, Davis, Jim Wynn, and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings, according to the manager. After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via the Baltimore chop, Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch. He responded with a two-run double, but Wynn - playing first for Davis - popped up, and the Astros didn\\'t score any more in that inning. They did score 3 in the fourth to erase a 3-2 deficit, and the Astros wound up winning 6-4. They threatened to do even better the next game, as Tommy John would be their opponent. Walt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A.M. before the game. \"I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop,\" he explained. \"How can we do that,\" Pee Wee Reese wondered. \"They\\'re going to be beating the ball down, so we\\'ve got to be ready to throw on the run. Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt, but I want all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws. We\\'ll go with a shallow infield almost the whole time.\" The plan almost worked. Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eight innings, but the Astros got three; two of them scored when Bill Doran pushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and third. 3-2 Astros was the final, with Dave Smith earning another save. The Dodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday, as Nolan Ryan walked five, three of whom scored in a 4-1 Dodger win. Fernando Valenzuela lost the second game 4-2 to Don Sutton, however, as the Dodgers\\' thirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough. \"We\\'re mostly a power team,\" remarked Ron Cey. \"Jackie and, when he plays, Maury Wills are our only real speed demons, though a couple other plays can do it now and then. We\\'re sunk in a place like the Astrodome. I guess that\\'s why they\\'re so successful there.\" Indeed, it seems that basestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome. The \\'Stros swiped 12 bases in 16 attempts, giving them 230 on the season.

       " \"Let's look at the effects of inflation on 1930's superstars' salaries. I read once that the Babe made $80,000 one year and that was about as good as it got for him. Let's assume he made that in 1928 (I'm not sure of the figures, but I know I'm in the ballpark--pun intended). :-) Today, assuming a 4% yearly inflation rate, which is an understatement if not accurate, his measly $80,000 salary would be worth. FV = $80,000 x (1+4%)^(1993-1928) = $80,000 x (1.04)^65 = just over $1,000,000. Assuming inflation is average of around 5%. FV = $80,000 x (1+5%)^65 = almost 2,000,000. (I didn't crunch these numbers beforehand). These numbers might lead one to believe that today's players are slightly overpaid. The Babe appears to have made then what today's average to above average players make now. Perfectly accurate salary, year of salary, and average inflation rate would make this analysis more accurate, but I don`t think I'm off by much.

Tapani and Erickson are also young, and have looked very good this spring. The last spot was between Jim Deshaies, formerly of Houston and S.D. and Mike Trombley. Deshaies hasn\\'t looked very good this spring, so I believe that the spot has gone to Trombley, although they hadn\\'t wanted 3 starters this unproven. I personally believe very highly in Mahomes and Trombley. > >2. Who is playing short and third? Well, Scott Leius is the shortstop. He played mostly 3B last year, but was a SS in the minors, and moved back after Gagne left to K.C. 3B is split (maybe) between Pagliarulo, who has had a great spring, and Terry Jorgenson, a good looking kid who has languished in Portland for 3 years. I\\'m not sure how the time will be divided, but they seem to be happy with what they have here. I like Jorgenson, but I fear they might give too much time to Pags. >3. How\\'s Winfield doing? Sorry, can\\'t help you here. Dennis',\n",

If the most Frequently Asked Question in rec.motorcycles is \"What is the DoD?\", then the second most Frequently Asked Question must be \"How do I get a DoD number?\" That is as simple as asking the Keeper of the List (KotL, accept no substitue Keepers) for a number. If you\\'re feeling creative, and your favorite number hasn\\'t been taken already, you can make a request, subject to KotL approval. (Warning, non-numeric, non- base-10 number requests are likely to earn a flame from the KotL. Not that you won\\'t get it, but you _will_ pay for it.) Oh, and just one little, tiny suggestion. Ask the KotL in e-mail. You\\'ll just be playing the lightning rod for flames if you post to the whole net, and you\\'ll look like a clueless newbie too. By now you\\'re probably asking \"So who\\'s the KotL already?\". Well, as John Sloan notes below, that\\'s about the only real \"secret\" left around here, but a few (un)subtle hints can be divulged. First, it is not myself, nor anyone mentioned by name in this posting (maybe :-), though John was the original KotL. Second, in keeping with the true spirit of Unix, the KotL\\'s first name is only two letters long, and can be spelled entirely with hexadecimal characters. (2.5, the KotL shares his name with a line- oriented text utility.) Third, he has occasionally been seen posting messages bestowing new DoD numbers (mostly to boneheads with \"weenie mailers\"). Fourth, there is reason to suspect the KotL of being a Dead-Head. ***************** Newsflash: A message from the KotL ****************** Once you have surmounted this intellectual pinnacle and electronically groveled to the KotL, please keep in mind that the KotL does indeed work for a living, and occasionally must pacify its boss by getting something done. Your request may languish in mailer queue for (gasp!) days, perhaps even (horrors!) a week or two. During such times of economic activity on the part of the KotL\\'s employers, sending yet another copy of your request will not speed processing of the queue (it just makes it longer, verification of this phenominon is left as an excersize for the reader). If you suspect mailer problems, at least annotate subsequent requests with an indication that a former request was submitted, lest you be assigned multiple numbers (what, you think the KotL *memorizes* the list?!?). *********************************************************************** One more thing, the KotL says that its telepathic powers aren\\'t what they used to be. So provide some information for the list, will ya? The typical DoD List entry contains number, name, state/country, & e-mail address. For example: 0111:Ed Green:CA:ed.green@East.Sun.COM (PS: While John mentions below that net access and a bike are the only requirements for DoD membership, that\\'s not strictly true these days, as there are a number of Denizens who lack one or both.) Blaine (Dances With Bikers) Gardner blgardne@javelin.sim.es.com ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \"Denizens of Doom\", by Bruce Tanner (DoD 0161) [Road Rider, August 1991, reprinted with Bruce\\'s permission] There is a group of motorcyclists that gets together and does all the normal things that a bunch of bikers do. They discuss motorcycles and motorcycling, beverages, cleaning fluids, baklavah, balaclava, caltrops, helmets, anti-fog shields, spine protectors, aerodynamics, three-angle valve seats, bird hits, deer whistles, good restaurants, racing philosophy, traffic laws, tickets, corrosion control, personalities, puns, double entendres, culture, absence of culture, first rides and friendship. They argue with each other and plan rides together. The difference between this group and your local motorcycle club is that, although they get together just about everyday, most have never seen each other face to face. The members of this group live all over the known world and communicate with each other electronically via computer. The computers range from laptops to multi-million dollar computer centers; the people range from college and university students to high-tech industry professionals to public-access electronic bulletin-board users. Currently, rec.motorcycles (pronounced \"wreck-dot-motorcycles,\" it\\'s the file name for the group\\'s primary on-line \"meeting place\") carries about 2250 articles per month; it is read by an estimated 29,000 people. Most of the frequent posters belong to a motorcycle club, the Denizens of Doom, usually referred to as the DoD. The DoD started when motorcyclist John R. Nickerson wrote a couple of parodies designed to poke fun at motorcycle stereotypes. Fellow computer enthusiast Bruce Robinson posted these articles under the pen name, \"Denizen of Doom.\" A while later Chuck Rogers signed off as DoD nr. 0003 Keeper of the Flame. Bruce was then designated DoD nr. 0002, retroactively and, of course, Nickerson, the originator of the parodies, was given DoD nr. 0001. The idea of a motorcycle club with no organization, no meetings and no rules appealed to many, so John Sloan -- DoD nr. 0011 -- became Keeper of the List, issuing DoD numbers to anyone who wanted one. To date there have been almost 400 memberships issued to people all over the United States and Canada, as well as Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Norway and Finland. Keeper of the List Sloan eventually designed a club patch. The initial run of 300 patches sold out immediately. The profits from this went to the American Motorcycle Heritage Foundation. Another AMHF fund raiser -- selling Denizens of Doom pins to members -- was started by Arnie Skurow a few months later. Again, the project was successful and the profits were donated to the foundation. So far, the Denizens have contributed over $1500 to the AMA museum. A plaque in the name of the Denizens of Doom now hangs in the Motorcycle Heritage Museum. As often as possible, the DoD\\'ers crawl out from behind their CRTs and go riding together. It turns out that the two largest concentrations of DoD\\'ers are centered near Denver/Boulder, Colorado, and in California\\'s \"Silicon Valley.\" Consequently, two major events are the annual Assault on Rollins Pass in Colorado, and the Northern versus Southern California \"Joust.\" The Ride-and-Feed is a bike trip over Rollins Pass, followed by a big barbecue dinner. The concept for the Joust is to have riders from Northern California ride south; riders from Southern California to ride north, meeting at a predesignated site somewhere in the middle. An additional plan for 1991 is to hold an official Denizens of Doom homecoming in conjunction with the AMA heritage homecoming in Columbus, Ohio, in July. Though it\\'s a safe bet the the Denizens of Doom and their collective communications hub, rec.motorcycles, will not replace the more traditional motorcycle organizations, for those who prowl the electronic pathways in search of two-wheeled camaraderie, it\\'s a great way for kindred spirits to get together. Long may they flame. \"Live to Flame -- Flame to Live\" [centerbar] This official motto of the Denizens of Doom refers to the ease with which you can gratuitously insult someone electronically, when you would not do anything like that face to face. These insults are known as \"flames\"; issuing them is called \"flaming.\" Flames often start when a member disagrees with something another member has posted over the network. A typical, sophisticated, intelligent form of calm, reasoned rebuttal would be something like: \"What an incredibly stupid statement, you Spandex-clad poseur!\" This will guarantee that five other people will reply in defense of the original poster, describing just what they think of you, your riding ability and your cat. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ _The Denizens of Doom: The Saga Unfolds_ by John Sloan DoD #0011 Periodically the question \"What is DoD?\" is raised. This is one of those questions in the same class as \"Why is the sky blue?\", \"If there is a God, why is there so much suffering in the world?\" and \"Why do women inevitably tell you that you\\'re such a nice guy just before they dump you?\", the kinds of questions steeped in mysticism, tradition, and philosophy, questions that have inspired research and discussion by philosophers in locker rooms, motorcycle service bays, and in the halls of academe for generations. A long, long time ago (in computer time, where anything over a few minutes is an eternity and the halting problem really is a problem) on a computer far, far away on the net (topologically speaking; two machines in the same room in Atlanta might route mail to one another via a system in Chicago), a chap who wished to remain anonymous (but who was eventually assigned the DoD membership #1) wrote a satire of the various personalities and flame wars of rec.motorcycles, and signed it \"The Denizen of Doom\". Not wishing to identify himself, he asked that stalwart individual who would in the fullness of time become DoD #2 to post it for him. DoD #2, not really giving a whit about what other people thought and generally being a right thinking individual, did so. Flaming and other amusements followed. He who would become the holder of DoD membership #3 thought this was the funniest thing he\\'d seen in a while (being the sort that is pretty easily amused), so he claimed membership in the Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club, and started signing his postings with his membership number. Perhaps readers of rec.motorcycles were struck with the vision of a motorcycle club with no dues, no rules, no restrictions as to brand or make or model or national origin of motorcycle, a club organized electronically. It may well be that readers were yearning to become a part of something that would provide them with a greater identity, a gestalt personality, something in which the whole was greater than the sum of its parts. It could also be that we\\'re all computer nerds who wear black socks and sneakers and pocket protectors, who just happen to also love taking risks on machines with awesome power to weight ratios, social outcasts who saw a clique that would finally be open minded enough to accept us as members. In a clear case of self fulfilling prophesy, The Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club was born. A club in which the majority of members have never met one another face to face (and perhaps like it that way), yet feel that they know one another pretty well (or well enough given some of the electronic personalities in the newsgroup). A club organized and run (in the loosest sense of the word) by volunteers through the network via electronic news and mail, with a membership/mailing list (often used to organize group rides amongst members who live in the same region), a motto, a logo, a series of photo albums circulating around the country (organized by DoD #9), club patches (organized by #11), and even an MTV-style music video (produced by #47 and distributed on VHS by #18)! Where will it end? Who knows? Will the DoD start sanctioning races, placing limits on the memory and clock rate of the on-board engine management computers? Will the DoD organize poker runs where each participant collects a hand of hardware and software reference cards? Will the DoD have a rally in which the attendees demand a terminal room and at least a 386-sized UNIX system? Only time will tell. The DoD has no dues, no rules, and no requirements other than net access and a love for motorcycles. To become a member, one need only ask (although we will admit that who you must ask is one of the few really good club secrets). New members will receive via email a membership number and the latest copy of the membership list, which includes name, state, and email address. The Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club will live forever (or at least until next year when we may decided to change the name).

The Names have been changes to protect the Guilty (riders) and Innocent (the bikes) alike. If you think you recognize a contorted version of your name, you don\\'t. It\\'s just your guilt complex working against you. Read \\'em and weep. We tune in on a conversation between some of our heros. Terrible Barbarian is extolling the virtues of his Hopalonga Puff-a-cane to Reverend Muck Mudgers and Stompin Fueling-Injection: Terrible: This Hopalonga is the greatest... Beats BMWs dead!! Muck: I don\\'t mean to preach, Terrible, but lighten up on the BMW crowd eh? I mean like I like riding my Yuka-yuka Fudgeo-Jammer 11 but what the heck. Stompin: No way, the BMW is it, complete, that\\'s all man. Terrible: Nahhhh, you\\'re sounding like Heritick Ratatnack! Hey, at least he is selling his BMW and uses a Hopalonga Intercorruptor! Not as good as a Puff-a-cane, should have been called a Woosh-a-stream. Stompin: You mean Wee-Stream. Terrible: Waddya going to do? Call in reinforcements??? Stompin: Yehh man. Here comes Arlow Scarecrow and High Tech. Let\\'s see what they say, eh? Muck: Now men, let\\'s try to be civil about this. High Tech: Hi, I\\'m a 9 and the BMW is the greatest. Arlow: Other than my B.T. I love my BMW! Terrible: B.T.??? Arlow: Burley Thumpison, the greatest all American ride you can own. Muck: Ahhh, look, you\\'re making Terrible gag. Terrible: What does BMW stand for anyway??? Muck, Arlow, High: Beats Me, Wilhelm. Terrible: Actually, my name is Terrible. Hmmm, I don\\'t know either. Muck: Say, here comes Chunky Bear. Chunky: Hey, Hey, Hey! Smarter than your average bear! Terrible: Hey, didn\\'t you drop your BMW??? Chunky: All right eh, a little BooBoo, but I left him behind. I mean even Villy Ogle flamed me for that! Muck: It\\'s okay, we all makes mistakes. Out of the blue the West coasters arrive, led by Tread Orange with Dill Snorkssy, Heritick Ratatnack, Buck Garnish, Snob Rasseller and the perenial favorite: Hooter Boobin Brush! Heritick: Heya Terrible, how\\'s yer front to back bias? Terrible: Not bad, sold yer BMW? Heritick: Nahhh. Hooter: Hoot, Hoot. Buck: Nice tree Hooter, how\\'d ya get up there? Hooter: Carbujectors from Hell!!! Muck: What\\'s a carbujector? Hooter: Well, it ain\\'t made of alumican!!! Made by Tilloslert!! Muck: Ahh, come on down, we aren\\'t going to flame ya, honest!! Dill: Well, where do we race? Snob: You know, Chunky, we know about about your drop and well, don\\'t ride! Muck: No! No! Quiet! Tread: BMW\\'s are the greatest in my supreme level headed opinion. They even have luggage made by Sourkraut! High: My 9 too! Terrible, Heritick, Dill, Buck: Nahhhhh!!! Stompin, Tread, High, Chunky, Snob: Yesss Yessssss!!! Before this issue could be resolved the Hopalonga crew called up more cohorts from the local area including Polyanna Stirrup and the infamous Booster Robiksen on his Cavortin! Polyanna: Well, men, the real bikers use stirrups on their bikes like I use on my Hopalonga Evening-Bird Special. Helpful for getting it up on the ole ventral stand! Terrible: Hopalonga\\'s are great like Polyanna says and Yuka-Yuka\\'s and Sumarikis and Kersnapis are good too! Booster: I hate Cavortin. All: WE KNOW, WE KNOW. Booster: I love Cavortin. All: WE KNOW WE KNOW. Muck: Well, what about Mucho Guzlers and Lepurras? Snob, Tread: Nawwwwww. Muck: What about a Tridump? Terrible: Isn\\'t that a chewing gum? Muck: Auggggg, Waddda about a Pluck-a-kity? Heritick: Heyya Muck, you tryin\\' to call up the demon rider himself? Muck: No, no. There is more to Mudder-Disciples than arguing about make. Two more riders zoom in, in the form of Pill Turret and Phalanx Lifter. Pill: Out with dorsal stands and ventral stands forever. Phalanx: Hey, I don\\'t know about that. And Now even more west coasters pour in. Road O\\'Noblin: Hopalonga\\'s are the greatest! Maulled Beerstein: May you sit on a bikejector! Suddenly more people arrived from the great dark nurth: Kite Lanolin: Hey, BMW\\'s are great, men. Robo-Nickie: I prefer motorcycle to robot transformers, personally. More riders from the west coast come into the discussion: Aviator Sourgas: Get a Burley-Thumpison with a belted-rigged frame. Guess Gasket: Go with a BMW or Burley-Thumpison. With a roar and a screech the latest mudder-disciple thundered in. It was none other that Clean Bikata on her Hopalonga CaBammerXorn. Clean: Like look, Hopalonga are it but only CaBammerXorns. Muck: Why?? Clean: Well, like it\\'s gotta be a 6-banger or nothin. Muck: But I only have a 4-banger. Clean: No GOOD! Chunky: Sob, some of us only have 2-bangers! Clean: Inferior! Stompin: Hey, look, here\\'s proof BMW\\'s are better. The Bimmer-Boys burst into song: (singing) Beemer Babe, Beemer Babe give me a thrill... Road, Terrible, Polyanna, Maulled, Dill etc.: Wadddoes BMW stand for? Heritick, Stompin, Snob, Chunky, Tread, Kite, High, Arlow: BEAT\\'S ME, WILHEM! Road, Terrible, Polyanna, Maulled, Dill etc.: Oh, don\\'t you mean BMW? And so the ensuing argument goes until the skies clouded over and the thunder roared and the Greatest Mudder-Disciple (G.M.D.) of them all boomed out. G.M.D.: Enough of your bickering! You are doomed to riding Bigot & Suction powered mini-trikes for your childish actions. All: no, No, NO!!! Puhlease. Does this mean that all of the wreck.mudder-disciples will be riding mini-trikes? Are our arguing heros doomed? Tune in next week for the next gut wretching episode of \"The Yearning and Riderless\" with its ever increasing cast of characters. Where all technical problems will be flamed over until well done. Next week\\'s episode will answer the question of: \"To Helmet or Not to Helmet\" will be aired, this is heady material and viewer discretion is advised. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Script for the Denizens of Doom Anthem Video by Jonathan E. Quist DoD #94 [Scene: A sterile engineering office. A lone figure, whom we\\'ll call Chuck, stands by a printer output bin, wearing a white CDC lab coat, with 5 mechanical pencils in a pocket protector.] (editor\\'s note: For some reason a great deal of amusement was had at the First Annual DoD Uni-Coastal Ironhorse Ride & Joust by denizens referring to each other as \"Chuck\". I guess you had to be there. I wasn\\'t.) Chuck: I didn\\'t want to be a Software Systems Analyst, cow-towing to the whims of a machine, and saying yessir, nosir, may-I-have-another-sir. My mother made me do it. I wanted to live a man\\'s life, [Music slowly builds in background] riding Nortons and Triumphs through the highest mountain passes and the deepest valleys, living the life of a Motorcyclist; doing donuts and evading the police; terrorizing old ladies and raping small children; eating small dogs for tea (and large dogs for dinner). In short, I Want to be A Denizen! [Chuck rips off his lab coat, revealing black leather jacket (with fringe), boots, and cap. Scene simultaneously changes to the top of an obviously assaulted Rollins Pass. A small throng of Hell\\'s Angels sit on their Harleys in the near background, gunning their engines, showering lookers-on with nails as they turn donuts, and leaking oil on the tarmac. Chuck is standing in front of a heavily chromed Fat Boy.] Chuck [Sings to the tune of \"The Lumberjack Song\"]: I\\'m a Denizen and I\\'m okay, I flame all night and I ride all day. [Hell\\'s Angels Echo Chorus, surprisingly heavy on tenors]: He\\'s a Denizen and he\\'s okay, He flames all night and he rides all day. I ride my bike; I eat my lunch; I go to the lavat\\'ry. On Wednesdays I ride Skyline, Running children down with glee. [Chorus]: He rides his bike; He eats his lunch; He goes to the lavat\\'ry. On Wednesdays he rides Skyline, Running children down with glee. [Chorus refrain]: \\'Cause He\\'s a Denizen... I ride real fast, My name is Chuck, It somehow seems to fit. I over-rate the worst bad f*ck, But like a real good sh*t. Oh, I\\'m a Denizen and I\\'m okay! I flame all night and I ride all day. [Chorus refrain]: Oh, He\\'s a Denizen... I wear high heels And bright pink shorts, full leathers and a bra. I wish I rode a Harley, just like my dear mama. [Chorus refrain] ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Why you have to be killed. Well, the first thing you have to understand (just in case you managed to read this far, and still not figure it out) is that the DoD started as a joke. And in the words of one Denizen, it intends to remain one. Sometime in the far distant past, a hapless newbie asked: \"What does DoD stand for? It\\'s not the Department of Defense is it?\" Naturally, a Denizen who had watched the movie \"Top Gun\" a few times too many rose to the occasion and replied: \"That\\'s classified, we could tell you, but then we\\'d have to kill you.\" And the rest is history. A variation on the \"security\" theme is to supply disinformation about what DoD stands for. Notable contributions (and contributers, where known) include: Daughters of Democracy (DoD 23) Doers of Donuts Dancers of Despair (DoD 9) Debasers of Daughters Dickweeds of Denver Driveway of Death Debauchers of Donuts Dumpers of Dirtbikes Note that this is not a comprehensive list, as variations appear to be limited only by the contents of one\\'s imagination or dictionary file. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ The rec.moto.photo archive First a bit of history, this all started with Ilana Stern and Chuck Rogers organizing a rec.motorcycles photo album. Many copies were made, and several sets were sent on tours around the world, only to vanish in unknown locations. Then Bruce Tanner decided that it would be appropriate for an electronic medium to have an electronic photo album. Bruce has not only provided the disk space and ftp & e-mail access, but he has taken the time to scan most of the photos that are available from the archive. Not only can you see what all these folks look like, you can also gawk at their motorcycles. A few non-photo files are available from the server too, they include the DoD membership list, the DoD Yellow Pages, the general rec.motorcycles FAQ, and this FAQ posting. Here are a couple of excerpts from from messages Bruce posted about how to use the archive. ********************************************************** Via ftp: cerritos.edu [130.150.200.21] Via e-mail: The address is server@cerritos.edu. The commands are given in the body of the message. The current commands are DIR and SEND, given one per line. The arguments to the commands are VMS style file specifications. For rec.moto.photo the file spec is [DOD]file. For example, you can send: dir [dod] send [dod]bruce_tanner.gif send [dod]dodframe.ps and you\\'ll get back 5 mail messages; a directory listing, 3 uuencoded parts of bruce_tanner.gif, and the dodframe.ps file in ASCII. Oh, wildcards (*) are allowed, but a maximum of 20 mail messages (rounded up to the next whole file) are send. A \\'send [dod]*.gif\\' would send 150 files of 50K each; not a good idea. -- Bruce Tanner (213) 860-2451 x 596 Tanner@Cerritos.EDU Cerritos College Norwalk, CA cerritos!tanner ********************************************************** A couple of comments: Bruce has put quite a bit of effort into this, so why not drop him a note if you find the rec.moto.photo archive useful? Second, since Bruce has provided the server as a favor, it would be kind of you to access it after normal working hours (California time). ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Patches? What patches? You may have heard mention of various DoD trinkets such as patches & pins. And your reaction was probably: \"I want!\", or \"That\\'s sick!\", or perhaps \"That\\'s sick! I want!\" Well, there\\'s some good news and some bad news. The good news is that there\\'s been an amazing variety of DoD-labeled widgets created. The bad news is that there isn\\'t anywhere you can buy any of them. This isn\\'t because of any \"exclusivity\" attempt, but simply because there is no \"DoD store\" that keeps a stock. All of the creations have been done by individual Denizens out of their own pockets. The typical procedure is someone says \"I\\'m thinking of having a DoD frammitz made, they\\'ll cost $xx.xx, with $xx.xx going to the AMA museum. Anyone want one?\" Then orders are taken, and a batch of frammitzes large enough to cover the pre-paid orders is produced (and quickly consumed). So if you want a DoD doodad, act quickly the next time somebody decides to do one. Or produce one yourself if you see a void that needs filling, after all this is anarchy in action. Here\\'s a possibly incomplete list of known DoD merchandise (and perpetrators). Patches (DoD#11), pins (DoD#99), stickers (DoD#99), motorcycle license plate frames (DoD#216), t-shirts (DoD#99), polo shirts (DoD#122), Zippo lighters (DoD#99) [LtF FtL], belt buckles (DoD#99), and patches (DoD#99) [a second batch was done (and rapidly consumed) by popular demand]. All \"profits\" have been donated to the American Motorcyclist Association Motorcycle Heritage Museum. As of June 1992, over $5500 dollars has been contributed to the museum fund by the DoD. If you visit the museum, you\\'ll see a large plaque on the Founders\\' Wall in the name of \"Denizens of Doom, USENET, The World\", complete with a DoD pin. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Here\\'s a letter from the AMA to the DoD regarding our contributions. ~Newsgroups: rec.motorcycles ~From: Arnie Skurow <arnie@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu> ~Subject: A letter from the Motorcycle Heritage Museum ~Date: Mon, 13 Apr 1992 11:04:58 GMT I received the following letter from Jim Rogers, director of the Museum, the other day. \"Dear Arnie and all members of the Denizens of Doom: Congratulations and expressions of gratitude are in order for you and the Denizens of Doom! With your recent donation, the total amount donated is now $5,500. On behalf of the AMHF, please extend my heartfeld gratitude to all the membership of the Denizens. The club\\'s new plaque is presently being prepared. Of course, everyone is invited to come to the museum to see the plaque that will be installed in our Founders Foyer. By the way, I will personally mount a Denizens club pin on the plaque. Again, thank you for all your support, which means so much to the foundation, the museum, and the fulfillment of its goals. Sincerely, Jim Rogers, D.O.D. #0395 Director P.S.

Estimated rec.motorcycles readership: 35K [news.groups] Approximate DoD Membership: 975 [KotL] DoD contributions to the American Motorcyclist Association Motorcycle Heritage Museum. Over $5500 [Arnie] Organized (?) Rides: Summer 1992 saw more organized rides, with the Joust in its third year, and the Ride & Feed going strong, but without the Rollins Pass trip due to the collapse of a tunnel. The East Coast Denizens got together for the Right Coast Ride (RCR), with bikers from as far north as NH, and as far south as FL meeting in the Blueridge Mountains of North Carolina. The Pacific Northwest crew organized the first Great Pacific Northwest Dryside Gather (GPNDG), another successful excuse for riding motorcycles, and seeing the faces behind the names we all have come to know so well. [Thanks to Ed Green for the above addition.] Also worth mentioning are: The first rec.moto.dirt ride, held in the Moab/Canyonlands area of southern Utah. Riders from 5 states showed up, riding everything from monster BMWs to itty-bitty XRs to almost-legal 2-strokes. And though it\\'s not an \"official\" (as if anything could be official with this crowd) rec.moto event, the vintage motorcycle races in Steamboat Springs, Colorado always provides a good excuse for netters to gather. There\\'s also been the occasional Labor Day gather in Utah. European Denizens have staged some gathers too.

His equivalent average started at .253 in 88, was up to .274 in 89 and 286 in 90. So let us say he had established, in his last two seasons, a .280 level of play. That is good. Very good, in fact. But it probably doesn't make the top ten in the league. The 10th best EQA in the AL in 1992 was Dave Winfield's .296; Thomas was first at .350. First in the NL was Bonds, an incroyable .378; tenth was Bip Roberts, .297. But .280 is better than any season in the past five years by Joe Carter; it is about what Mattingly had in 1988 (.285); what Felix Jose had the last two years; just ahead of Time Raines' five-year average; better than Ryan Klesko's MLEs. He got more attention from the media than was warranted from his baseball playing, though; his hype was a lot better than his hitting. That is the basis for the net.comments about him being overrated. The media would have you beleive he was a great hitter. I think he was a good, maybe very good hitter. He was IMO, something like the 30th best hitter in the majors. Clay D.\",\n",

Anyone else catch ESPN\\'s piece about prospects and the relationship between age, career length, MVPs and Hall of Fame members? It was part of their preseason special. Basically, they looked at players that had amassed 1000 plate appearances (or ABs) by the time they were 24, and noticed some interesting things. For starters, they found out such players comprised the majority of MVPs in the history of the game. They also found out such players represented the majority of the players in the hall of fame. The kicker, though, was that they actually did some number-crunching and found that such players\\' careers lasted much longer than the careers of players not in that group. They also found that these players produced at both a greater level of performance and produced over twice the raw totals (HRs, etc) of the other players.

Many teams have opted for a return to a previous style of uniform, or at least uniforms that look more traditional.

With the emergence of the O's and the Yanks, it is far and away the best. While the N.L. West has the best team in baseball, and the Reds aren't bad either, they have nothing else. The Giants, Astros, and Padres all have talent, they do not have the all arounf teams that are found in the A.L. East. And the Dodgers just plain suck. As for the Rockies, who knows? The A.L. East has the defending champs, and although they lost a lot to free agency, Toronto is still one of the best in baseball. The Orioles have the preseason favorite to win the Cy Young in Mike Mussina, and you can never forget about Ripken. The signings of Harold Baines and Harold Reynolds don't hurt to much either, although I always liked Bill Ripken. While they let a lot go this summer (Randy Milligan, Joe Orsulak, Bill Ripken, Bob Milacki, Sam Horn, Storm Davis, and Craig Lefferts), they kept the heart of their team intact. My predicted finish: 1. Baltimore (Could be a biased opinion) 2. NY Yankees 3. Toronto 4. Milwaukee 5. Detroit 6. Boston 7.

Still, the man actually had the gall to say that one out of every six pitchers in the NL this year did not pitch in the majors last year. Huh? IMO, this expansion will not see the explosive jump in offense that the other expansion drafts had, since the talent was diluted over both leagues. In Gammons\\' defense, because the talent drain came from the AL as well, some increase will be seen.

I\\'m not quite sure how these numbers are generated. It appears that in a neutral park Bo\\'s HR and slugging tend to drop (he actually loses two home runs). Or do they? What is \"equivalent average?\" One thing, when looking at Bo\\'s stats, is that you can see that KC took away some homers. Normally, you expect some would-be homers to go for doubles or triples in big parks, or to be caught, and for that matter you expect lots of doubles and triples anyway. But Bo, despite his speed, hit very few doubles and not that many triples. So I would expect his value to have risen quite considerably in a neutral park. > That is good. Very good, in fact.

Felix Jose has been a .350/.440 player in a fairly neutral park. I would offhand guess the `89-`90 Bo at around a .330/.530 player. Maybe .330/.550 . Not even close. > He got more attention from the media than was warranted from his > baseball playing, though; his hype was a lot better than his hitting. > That is the basis for the net.comments about him being overrated. The > media would have you beleive he was a great hitter. I think he was a > good, maybe very good hitter. He was IMO, something like the 30th best > hitter in the majors. I\\'d put him about there too. Note: I hadn\\'t realized the media had hyped him so much. I thought he was always viewed by them as a better football player, and only so-so at baseball. He did only have one 30-hr, 100-rbi season, and KC wasn\\'t winning. Note 2: I maybe have harped on this a bit in the past, but there is a mistake being made (by the SDCN\\'s, as they are known, on this group) with respect to players like Bo and Deion and Lofton (and perhaps others). We find, that if you look at a large group of players, their past major and minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well. Their are some caveats: the younger they are, the less good the prediction; the lower the minor league, the less good (I imagine), the more recent the player has left college ball, etc. Now of course, this prediction involves quite a bit of \"error.\" Sometimes a player with poor MLE\\'s (Dave Justice, the 1990 Ventura) becomes a star. Some hitters develop (Shane Mack, Brian Downing), some don\\'t (Oddibe McDowell, Mickey Brantley). This error involves real things: there are real reasons why Oddibe didn\\'t hit and Shane did. It may (who knows) involve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting and so on. But still, you have this big pool of players, and things work pretty well. One of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background of the players. One thing we know about professional baseball players is that all of them (or almost all) have spent a good deal of time playing ball. Their backgrounds are similar. What hasn\\'t been established is what happens when you encounter a player with a different background? Is there some reason to believe that a Bo, or a Deion, or a Lofton, or a Tony Gwynn (?), or an Ainge, or so on, has such a different background, that the standard model and standard assumptions fit this person slowly? It hasn\\'t been established that you can use MLE\\'s with two-sport players. (It hasn\\'t been established that you can\\'t, but then statistics is, after all, an art). I personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually make completely nonsensical statements about Bo and Deion and Lofton. \"Look at those good-but-not-great minor league numbers,\" they say. Well, what happens if those numbers simply don\\'t mean what they usually mean? It might mean that Ken Lofton suddenly has a better year in Houston than Tuscon. It might mean that Deion suddenly has a better half-year in Atlanta than Greenville. Then again, it might not. Ken and Deion might go right back in the tank this year, live up to those poor MLE\\'s. But you guys DON\\'T KNOW. What\\'s worse, you don\\'t know that you don\\'t. And you don\\'t know that there are other players you won\\'t know about -- injuries and lifting and wheaties again. You seem to think that the model is perfect and eternal. It\\'s not. It\\'s got some error. Oh well. Bill Guilford still thinks \"hairy butt is truly ugly\" might be right',\n",

Why isn\\'t Lopez likely to hit that well? He hit that well last year (after adjusting his stats for park and league and such); he hit better (on an absolute scale) than Olson or Berryhill did.

If there really is a qualitative difference between the minors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment (and I don\\'t believe there is), then wouldn\\'t you rather waste Lopez\\'s 22-year old good season than his 23-year old very good season or his 24-year-old excellent season?

Ummm. Justice is a very fine hitter. Pendleton might have another big year in his bat, but he might also spend the season in Hamstring Hell. Gant is a big question mark. The Bream/Hunter platoon is decent (not excellent) and has rotten OBP or SLG (depending on who\\'s in). Blauser is a very valuable bat... for a shortstop. >The center >field platoon will probably hit .300.

The player must be periodically re-evaluated to determine if he\\'s still injured (thus you cannot park a player on the DL who maybe is out of options and you do not wish to expose to waivers).

       " 'Since I was the one responsible for these divergent threads of approx. 40+ posts (going back to: The Braves could be better off if an injury happens), I may as well inject a little more fuel to the flame! 1) Back at the beginning of Spring Training, I though Lopez would make the squad easily. Olson was still recovering from his late-season injury (knee, I believe), and there were questions as to whether he would be able to play before June. And then Berryhill was dinged up. I was looking forward to this, because I believe that Lopez can hit AND field the position. Before last season, he was the Braves \"Defensive Catcher\" prospect, while Brian Deak was the Braves \"Offensive Catcher\" prospect. Besides, Olson and Berryhill couldn\\'t hit their way out of a wet cardboard box, and don\\'t walk enough to be useful. But Olson recovered quickly, Berryhill recovered, and the Braves went with the two vets. I still say that if one of those two had been down at the start of the season, he wouldn\\'t have gotten his job back. 2) There is a certain logic to keeping Olson and Berryhill around. After all, ML catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and tear. There are teams out there without ONE average ML catcher (California and Seattle come to mind). Certainly, trying to move Olson or Berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work. Plus, you\\'d have to eat that salary, which isn\\'t huge, but isn\\'t tiddleywinks either (I think Olson\\'s at about $800,000, Berryhill at $450,000, but that\\'s only what I recall). 3) Yes, I think arbitration-eligibility may have a role to play in this also. What is it, that 5/6 of the 2+year players aren\\'t eligible for arbitration? Only the 1/6 that were on the roster the longest are eligible? Of course, the system may change, but the extent of that change is not yet known. From a business standpoint, it may make sense to keep Lopez down until June/the first time Olson/Berryhill go on the DL. 4) I am still disappointed that Lopez isn\\'t on the team. I still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the Braves, and the truth is that I\\'d rather see our best team on the field, which, IMO, includes Lopez. Of course,today we play the Cubs. Hopefully, we won\\'t need him. ;) As for the Schuerholz/Cox conversation, I imagine it went like this: (Remember, they\\'ve BOTH been GM\\'s) (the following is not meant to be read by the humor-impaired) Cox: OK, we\\'ve sent Jones down. His fielding could be a little smoother. Besides, Blauser can hit OK and his fielding is better than it used to be. Schuerholz: Well, we\\'ll have to send Nieves down too. Deion just won\\'t sign that baseball only contract. We can\\'t count on him in October, so we have to keep Nixon around for the defense. Besides, Gorman\\'s not ready to give up on Billy Hatcher yet. Once Hatcher\\'s gone AND Deion signs, we can move Nixon for Frankie Rodriguez. That ought to give us some pitching depth in 1995. Cox: Yep, that\\'ll be nice. Too bad Deion won\\'t sign. OK, I\\'ll look for Nieves when Justice starts having Berry-Berry...er, back problems again. Now, what about Klesko? Schuerholz: Well, we\\'ve still got to fork out another 1.5 mil for Bream. If we keep Klesko, we either lose the money or Cabrera. I keep dangling Sid in front of Dal Maxwell, but somehow he doesn\\'t seem to be the same GM. First Jeffries for Jose, and now Whiten for Clark! If he gets rid of Brian Jordan, then I\\'d HAVE to believe that he and Whitey Herzog switched bodies at the Winter Meetings! Cox: OK, keep trying on Bream, and I\\'ll wait til the trading deadline for my Hunter/Klesko platoon. Maybe I can get a few extra at-bats for Cabrera while we wait. Try California... if Snow starts slowly, maybe WhiteyDal will bite on Sid. And if that doesn\\'t work, then perhaps Sid\\'s knees could be \"persuaded\" to act up. There\\'s always the 15-day DL! Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha! Schuerholz: What about Caraballo? Cox: Well, he\\'s not that much better than Lemke. Maybe if he starts in Richmond, he\\'ll start walking more. Besides, if he\\'s going to be arbitration-eligible, better to stretch him out so that we actually get some value from him before he makes the big bucks. Schuerholz: Now, let\\'s see. That leaves Lopez. Cox: NOOOOO! I gotta keep Lopez! Sure, I didn\\'t think Olson would recover this quickly. Maybe I can talk Caminiti into running into him again? Schuerholz: Nope, Lopez has gotta go. You know that he\\'ll get $3 million in arbitration. May as well put it off that one extra year. Besides, until Olson\\'s shown his stuff a little bit, I can\\'t trade him. Besides, Berryhill\\'s a left-handed hitter. You know how rare that is? Cox: Don\\'t you mean a left-handed whiffer? Pretty common, if you ask me. I mean, he made Pat Borders look good in the World Series. PAT BORDERS!!! Schuerholz: Hey, you\\'re the one who wouldn\\'t write Lopez into the lineup. Cox: Well, you\\'re the one who went out and got me Jeff Reardon! Besides, I thought Lopez wouldn\\'t be used to our pitching staff\\'s stuff. He got some time with them this spring...looked pretty good. Come on, surely we only need to keep one stiff behind the plate? Schuerholz: Yeah, but which stiff? Whichever one we keep will be hurt by May. Cox: OK, OK, you made your point. Keep them both. Surely one of them will be on the DL by June at the latest. Then I can call up Lopez, and then we can win 110 games! The Pennant! THE WORLD SERIES! I\\'ll be up there with John McGraw! Casey Stengel! Earl Weaver! Oh, they laughed at me in Toronto, but have you ever had to deal with George Bell? I\\'ll finally get my just reward! Mwa-ha-ha-ha! Schuerholz: Easy, Bobby. Have you been taking those \"happy pills\" left around by Chuck Tanner? Why\\'d you ever hire that guy anyhow? Cox: Don\\'t ask me; ask Ted. ------------------------------------------------------- Eric Roush fierkelab@ bchm.biochem.duke.edu \"I am a Marxist, of the Groucho sort\" Grafitti, Paris, 1968 TANSTAAFL!

       " 'I\\'ve noticed that is has become fashionable lately in rsb to predict the Marlines to finish ahead of the Cubs....how? First Base: Grace vs Destrade...Could Destrade be the second coming of Cecil Fielder? I doubt it. If Destrade performs to the height of expectations, then even, otherwise, edge to Cubs Second Base: Sandberg vs Barberie...No contest. Sandberg will be back May 1. Edge to Cubs...a big edge. Shortstop: Vizcaino vs Weiss...Vizcaino is excellent defensively, but is an automatic out at bat. Weiss isn\\'t much better with the stick. Even. Third Base: Dave Magadan vs Buechelle...Magadan has a higher OBP and is a better hitter. Buechelle has more power and is better defensively (I think) Edge to Florida. Catcher: Santiago vs Wilkins...Wilkins is OK, but Santiago is better. Edge to Marlins Left Field: Conine vs Maldonado...Wow! 4 for 4 yesterday...I know Conine has potential. I watched him play at Omaha the last couple years. Until he actually proves himself, I give Maldonado the edge, however, like at 1B, this is position where Florida might be even or better *if* the player there has a huge year. Center: Scott Pose vs Wilson/May...Edge to May, even if Wilson. Hopefully the Cubs will use may and save Wilson for pinch running and the like. May isn\\'t Ken Griffey Jr, but he will hit .275 with 15 homers if he plays full time. Right: Felix vs Sosa...Felix Jose has occasional power and a bad OBP. So does Sosa, but Sosa also has speed and a good glove. Edge to Cubs Starters: Aquino? Armstrong? Hammond? A lot of fifth starters here. The Cubs won\\'t remind anyone of the Brave staff, but Morgan-Castillo-Guzman-Hibbard is average to OK...better than the Marline. Edge to Cubs Middle Relief: Even. The Cubs have some decent middlemen, and so do the Marlins. Carpenter anf Klink or decent, but so are Assenmacher and McElroy. Closer: A healthy Harvey is a big edge to the Marlins. Meyers is decent, but no Harvey. Of course, the Cubs may have a few more games to save. Look for 30 saves, 5 blown from Meyers, and 25 saves, 3 blown (with a better ERA) for Harvey. Edge Florida. Overall, an edge to Chicago.

       " 'Most of this discussion has been between Mark Singer and David Tate, with Valentine weighing in on the same side as Dave at various times. My opinion, FWIW, to all: Mark, age doesn\\'t matter; ability does. I would rather have the untried rookie with great minor league numbers than the veteran who has proven himself to be average at best. I don\\'t care if he is 15; if he plays better than what I have, I want him out there. Sandy Alomar had decent minor league numbers, grossly inflated by the PCL in general and Las Vegas in particular; he should have been projected as an average major league hitter (which is good for a catcher, I\\'ll admit). Santiago\\'s numbers would probably come out the same as Sandy\\'s, but I don\\'t have the league data from the mid-80s to check it out. That being said, I agree with sending Lopez to Richmond, at least to start the season. As the box below shows, he has *one* minor league season in which he hit well. He has two in which he hit very, very poorly. I want to see that the 92 Lopez is real. Olson and Berryhill are not complete mediocrities; for catchers, especially NL catchers, they are essentially average hitters, with equivalent averages around .220. If he had hit well at prior levels, I would say he belongs on the Braves; but there is a reasonable chance that Lopez last year was just as much a fluke as Alomar in 90 or Santiago in 87. One year at any level, at any age, doesn\\'t satisfy MY standards of evidence.

Granted, I thought his behavior with McCarver last year was completely bush. Last year was the first time he ever got 300 AB in one place, so his lines are hard to read. But he has a combined 720 OPS in minor league play; with his speed is more valuable than the OPS alone indicates; and at a still young age (24), had a monster year with an 868 OPS. He has a total, major and minor, EQA of .249; above major league average, and above average for CF (which was about .240 in the NL last year). He has shown at least the potential of going into the .290s, which would make him one of the 15 best hitters in the league. He has two full seasons before reaching his \"prime\" season of 27.

On 6/11/90 he pitched his 6th no-hitter against Oakland. I believe the last out in the game was made by Rickey Henderson.

Let\\'s kick it off with an example of a player who was \"rushed\", although there doesn\\'t seem to have been any damage to his career. Jay Bell was given 135 PAs in the major leagues at age 21, and performed well below what you would expect from his AAA numbers the same season. He got 236 PAs the next year at age 22, and still underperformed. However, the next year, at age 24, his performance improved, and he won the everyday shortstop job, and has been there ever since. It\\'s really hard for me to see where he would have been better off staying in the minor league (where he was performed quite well in AAA) during this time, rather than being \"rushed\"; Cleveland might have been better off, I suppose, because they might have been less likely to give up on him. Yes, if you bring a player up early, he\\'s likely going to struggle. But does that delay the time at which he stops struggling, and starts performing up to expectations?

I tend to agree that players are not hurt by early play in the big leagues. The BRaves organization is a fertile ground to test this hypothesis, as they had little talent on their roster for some time. Steve Avery, for example, was rushed to the majors, and he fared very poorly during his initial campaign. His subsequent pitching has not been affected by his 5+ ERA during his rookie year. Bill James pointed out that it was relatively unusual to struggle so and then rebound. Bob Horner was also rushed to the majors (out of Arizona State directly) had good numbers immediately.

Those are the arguments against Lopez for the >>Braves for this year. >>Now. The Braves have two catchers who have demonstrated solid >>abilities to call games, to work with the pitchers, to throw out >>runners. This is the crux of the argument (to me at least). Both the SDCN and the non-SDCN camps seem to agree on the fact that a catcher\\'s defense is basically nonmeasurable at present. You can talk about how important calling a game is, or framing the pitches, or blocking balls in the dirt. But there is little or no way to tell exactly how various catcher\\'s rank in \"defense\". Looking at Lopez specifically; is there any reason to suspect that he is a bad defensive catcher other then the fact that the Braves (or the media) has labeled him a bad defensive catcher? As far as I can tell he doesn\\'t have any particular problem in his mechanics (such as Sasser). He might be a little rough around the edges in blocking the ball, or framing the pitch to get a good call but all he needs to clear that up is playing and practice time. I can\\'t see how repetitions at AAA are any better then reps in the majors! All we\\'re left with is the calling the game aspect. Olsen and Berryhill at always given credit for calling good games and helping the pitchering staff. But this is a reputation that is given to almost all veteran catchers. How is catching at AAA going to help Lopez learn the major league pitching staff? The only way any catcher is going to learn Tom Glavine\\'s pitches is to catch Tom Glavine. Similarly, I wouldn\\'t be supprised if the pitcher\\'s claimed to prefer pitching to Olsen over pitching to Lopez because they are used to pitching to Olsen. But given time they will say they are comfortable with Lopez. Now, since Lopez can\\'t learn how to handle the major league pitcher\\'s while he\\'s in AAA and since he doesn\\'t have any glaring problem in his mechanics, what is he going to learn in AAA that he can\\'t learn just as well while in the majors?

For God's sake, Rickey, you signed a contract 4 years ago, now honor it and play!

       " 'Having run completely out of time, I\\'ve got to get my prophesies and predictions for the A.L. out. Qualifications -- one of the worse finishes in last year\\'s prediction contest. AL East -- 1993 1. Baltimore Orioles Why the Orioles? Well, I pondered long and hard, and it all came down to this: -- The Blue Jays are going the wrong direction. -- Can\\'t bring myself to pick the Yankees -- Milwaukee was a fluke -- Indians aren\\'t ready to contend -- Red Sox were bad last year, and didn\\'t get any better -- Detroit\\'s pitching will be the new definition of \"replacement level\" \"But you don\\'t really think the Orioles will win, do you.\" No. As a matter of fact, I can\\'t see any team in the American League winning either division on paper (with the possible exception of the Yankees, who I hate). But some- body has to win, so I pick the Orioles. \"You don\\'t really think that Brady Anderson is going to repeat, do you?\" No. I\\'m basing the Orioles prediction on the expectation of big years from Cal Ripken and Glenn Davis. \"Glenn Davis? That\\'s insane\". Yes. So, without further ado: STRONG POINTS: Hoiles, Ripken some years, Olson, getting rid of Billy Ripken. WEAK POINTS: Segui may start. Valenzuela (the original 30-something) may be the fifth starter. Oates puts his best hitters at the bottom of the lineup. (Does anybody else think that might be a calculated maneuver to minimize the effect of a slumping Ripken? If you can\\'t move Ripken out of the #3 spot, why not move the rest of the line up?) WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN: Glenn Davis wins comeback player of the year. WOULD BE A BAD SIGN: In a tight pennant race, team trades for Pecota. ObPrediction: \"The Streak\" continues. Harold Reynolds leads the team in caught stealing. 2. New York Yankees. STRONG POINTS: Abbot, Key, Perez. Could have best pitching in American League. Boggs should improve on Hayes. WEAK POINTS: Mattingly still considered best hitter. The Steinbrenner factor. (The Yankees lost to the Mets. Can wholesale changes be far behind?) Never count on rookie pitchers (i.e. Wickman & Millitello) to win a division. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN: Boggs hits over .300 WOULD BE A BAD SIGN: Howe gets arrested again. ObPrediction: Mattingly won\\'t top a 700 OPS. 3. Toronto Blue Jays STRONG POINTS: Management willing to make big deals. Management has eerie power to convince other teams its prospects are not suspects. Olerud. Guzman. Alomar. WEAK POINTS: The Jackson for Bell trade has shaken my faith in Gillick. Losing Stewart may hurt rotation (that\\'s *really* a bad sign). No one in the outfield can get on base. Pitching is thin behind Guzman and Ward. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN: Jack Morris considered Cy Young contender in August WOULD BE A BAD SIGN: Club makes no major deals in August. ObPrediction: Morris will post better ERA and WHIP totals than last year. And have a losing record. 4. Milwaukee Brewers STRONG POINTS: Pitching staff was exceptional -- last year. WEAK POINTS: Molitor gone. Surhoff at third? Why? Eldred can\\'t keep it up. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN: Listach and Eldred play like last year. WOULD BE BAD SIGN: Bones plays like last year. ObPrediction: Surhoff won\\'t finish the year at third. 5. Cleveland Indians STRONG POINTS: Baerga, Belle, Nagy WEAK POINTS: Pitching staff thin -- losing Olin really hurts. Starts Felix Fermin. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN: Bielecki\\'s ERA is consistent with his Atlanta starts. WOULD BE A BAD SIGN: Ted Power -- bullpen ace. ObPrediction: Alomar will be back on the DL by the all-star break. 6. Boston Red Sox STRONG POINTS: Clemens, Viola, Clemens, Detroit, Clemens WEAK POINTS: Most incompetent GM in baseball. Key free agent signing -- Andre Dawson. Burks is gone -- Hatcher in center. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN: Rainouts in between Clemens starts. WOULD BE A BAD SIGN: Clemens on the DL ObPrediction: Russell will make Sox fans forget Reardon. Interpret that how you will :-> 7. Detroit Tigers STRONG POINTS: Tettleton, Phillips, Whitaker WEAK POINTS: If Fielder keeps declining, he\\'ll be a shortstop this year. Worst rotation in baseball entirely replaced -- but not necessarily better. This year could be *very* ugly. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN: Cecil Fielder deserving the MVP. WOULD BE A BAD SIGN: Cecil Fielder not whining about deserving an MVP. ObPrediction: Cecil *won\\'t* lead the league in RBIs. One more division to go.... -- Dale J.

The secondary purpose, acutally the primary purpose from the standpoint of practicality, was to distributed the writes so as to avoid exceeing the maximum number of writes fof the EEPROM being used. The microprocessor also ignored pulses coming from the Hall effect at a rate any higher than 110 MPH so as to make spoofing the reading by bench pulsing at least somewhat undesirable. This was for an automobile that was not expected to ever exceed 110 MPH in operation. The case, of course, might not be the same for your 1993 RX-7! The ECM modules of some cars do indeed store info about conditions under which cars have been operated. Since steering angle and velocity data, etc is available it would not be difficult to collect all sorts of interesting demographic information about the drivers' use of the car. I am not aware of any manufacturer currently trying to enforce warranty restrictions based on reading out use data from the ECM. While it could be a potential invasion of your privacy for manufacturers to have access to data about your driving style, it could also provide valuable information from actual field use conditions to help engineer more appropriate cars. I personally wouldn't mind the dealer collecting my driving demographics as long as it is done in an anonymous fashion. -- Bill Mayhew NEOUCOM Computer Services Department Rootstown, OH 44272-9995 USA phone: 216-325-2511 wtm@uhura.neoucom.edu (140.220.1.1) 146.580: N8WED\",\n",

       " 'Howdy, I\\'m a little new to this newsgroup, but I would like to tap some of the knowledge and expertise available here. The Subject: After-market cruise controls The Background: I recently broke my ankle in a road-bicycling accident (4 places, five screws, yuk! :-( ). In two weeks I will be returning to Texas (my home) from my school (BYU) in Provo, Utah. As you can imagine, trying to drive nearly 1300 miles with a broken right ankle isn\\'t just the epitome of a good time. My car does not have a cruise control, so I would have to do all the pedalling (ha ha) with my messed-up ankle. My question: What is the general opinion of after-market cruise control units? I realize that a cheap CC (cruise control) from, say, Pep Boys, isn\\'t going to be as good as a factory or professionally installed unit (if there is such a thing). And I uderstand that I probably can\\'t expect much in the way of accuracy, looks and that sort of thing; But anything\\'s gotta be better than trying to drive with a hosed ankle. I have a 1984 Jeep Cherokee, 4 speed, standard, 4*4, 2.5L engine with kettering(sp?) ignition (y\\'know, distributor cap, rotor, that set-up--not electronic. Maybe you could\\'ve guessed it being an \\'84, but I\\'m just trying to give information as completly as I can). I found a CC unit for 80 bucks. It seems to use the vehicles vacuum system instead of an electric servor/motor. Is this good or bad? If I did buy this CC, which vacuum hose should I tap? It has two speed sensors: One magnetic, and one that gets a signal from the negative side of the distributor, kinda like a tach pick-up, or so I understand. I can use either one. Which is best? The manual says (I read it in the store today) that the magnetic/axle set-up is more accurate, but harder to install. Is there really a big difference? It has a sensor for the brake pedal, just like other CCs, but does NOT have a sensor for the clutch pedal. So if I wasn\\'t paying real close attention I might push the clutch in while the cruise is trying to get the speed up. Which would wind the engine up kinda high until I got my wits about me and turned the thing off. I\\'m pretty coordinated, so this doesn\\'t bother me, if it were for my girlfriends car, *then* it would bother me, but I\\'m ok with it. The installation also calls for an attachment to a steady-on brake signal and a switched-on brake signal. I think I can get a switched brake signal from the correct side of the brake light blade fuse. Am I right? But I\\'m not sure where to get the steady-on brake signal, or, for that matter, what exactly it is? Any ideas as to what the manufaturer wants and where to get it? I think I can figure the other things out. Like how to hook-up the negative side tach-type sensing gizmo and the cabin control unit, and the ground and all that miscellaneous business. But I need a little help with: 1. Is it worth the money and safety risk (if any) for such a device? 2. Is there any particularly good after-market CC? 3. Are \"professionally\" installed CCs signifacantly better and worth the cabbage? 4. If the unit I saw (sorry, no manufacturer or model number, just that it is at Pep Boy and its $80) is sufficient for my simple needs, how do I get the thing installed properly (specifically, the questions above)? My father and I built a \"Veep\" (Volkswagen powered Jeep CJ-2A) when I was in high school, so I consider myself fairly good with tools, electronics, and cars. So the installation doesn\\'t scare me. I just want to be certain that I get the thing installed correctly as my Cherokee is just a wee bit more complicated than my Veep. :-) I appreciate your time in reading my post, and I would appreciate any expertise or opinion anybody has on the subject. If you would like to share some of your wisdom, please email as I don\\'t get over this group very often (but I check my mail all the time). Again, thanks for any help anyone may have.

I had picked out the vehicle I wanted and after a little haggling we agreed on a price. I wrote them a check for the down payment plus tax and license and told them I'd be back that evening to pick up the truck. When I returned, I had to wait about an hour before the finance guy could get to me. When I finally got in there, everything went smoothly until he started adding up the numbers. He then discovered that they had miscalculated the tax & license by about $150. He then said he needed another $150 from me. I said we had already agreed on a price and it was their problem, I wasn't giving them any more money. The finance guy then brought in the manager on duty who proceeded to give me a hard time. I reminded him that I was the customer and I didn't think I should be treated like that and that if he didn't back off he could forget the whole deal. He made some smart remark so I told him where he could stick it, snatched back my check and left. Needless to say, they were not pleased by the turn of events. Early the next morning I got a call from the general sales manager wanting to know what happened. I related the story and he apologised profusely and asked if there was anything they could do to change my mind. I told him that if they gave me the truck for free I probably still wouldn't take it, that there were other dealers in town, I was a repeat customer of theirs and that they should learn how to treat customers,etc,etc...I was still pretty steamed about the whole affair. He gave me the line about hating to lose a customer and they would try to find a solution, etc, etc. I told him not to bother, thanks, I'd go somewhere else. A couple hours later, the owner of the dealership called me, all apologetic, etc, etc, etc, and said that they would cover the $150 plus knock another $400 off the price of the truck. I told him I'd think about it and he gave me his private, direct phone number, his secretary's name, and assured me that they valued me as a customer, etc etc etc.... I thought about it for a few hours and discussed it with my wife and we decided, what the hell...that was a pretty decent deal, so I called him back and accepted his offer. When I went back the next day to pick up the truck, I received the royal treatment. Everyone seemed to know about the incident, even the lot boy. Everything went smoothly and I was out of there in my new truck in about 30 mins. So, I guess I'm a reasonably satisfied customer. However, it should not have happened in the first place. I was a bit shocked to have a sales person talk to me like that. I don't expect them to bow and grovel, but I sure don't expect to be given a hard time either, esp. when it's their mistake. Anyway, I'm happy with the truck and it turned out to be a couple hundred dollars under invoice and they paid most of the first year's license fee. I'm not sure whether I'll go back to that dealer, tho. Mark\",\n",

       " 'Archive-name: rec-autos/part1 [most recent changes, 15 March 1993: addition of alt.autos.karting -- rpw] === Welcome to Rec.Autos.* === This article is sent out automatically each month, and contains a general description of the purpose of each of the automotive newsgroups, and some suggested guidelines for discussions. The keywords `Monthly Posting\\' will always appear to make killing this article easy for users of newsreaders with kill facilities. This article is posted to all autos groups, but followups are directed only to rec.autos. If you don\\'t understand what this means, ask your system administrator for help, or at least for copies of the newuser documentation. Failing that, please subscribe to the newsgroup news.announce.newusers and read the documentation provided there. Introduction to the Rec.Autos newsgroup hierarchy: rec.autos.tech is intended for technical discussions of automobiles, their design, construction, diagnosis, and service. Other discussions are largely inappropriate, especially For Sale ads. rec.autos.sport is intended for discussion of legal, organized competition involving automobiles. Technical discussions are appropriate insofar as they apply to competition vehicles. Discussion from either of two viewpoints, spectator and participant, is encouraged. Arguments about sports cars are largely inappropriate, as are most other discussions. For Sale ads are inappropriate unless they are for competition vehicles and/or equipment. Discussions of illegal events are marginal; one should probably avoid advocating breaking the law. (remember, the FBI reads Usenet!) rec.autos.driving is intended for discussions related to the driving of automobiles. Also, if you must discuss 55 vs. 65, or radar detectors, or <insert your pet driving peeve> boneheads, do it here. rec.autos.vw is intended for discussion of issues related to the use and ownership of automobiles manufactured by Volkswagen (this includes VWs, Audis, Seats, etc.) It was created on the grounds that the info-vw mailing list was very successful. It should not be presumed from the existence of this group that it is appropriate to create many groups to cover many different marques; groups specific to individual marques should only be created on demonstration of sufficient interest, via some avenue such as a mailing list. rec.audio.car is not properly part of the rec.autos.* hierarchy. it is, however, the correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment, and so is mentioned here. rec.autos.antique is intended for the discussion of older cars (usually more than 25 years old, although this is not a hard-and-fast rule.) alt.hotrod is not part of the hierarchy, but also of potential interest to the rec.autos reader. it is gatewayed to the moderated hotrod mailing list, and is for serious discussion of modifying and developing performance vehicles. alt.autos.rod-n-custom also not part of the `official\\' hierarchy; devoted to that peculiar American hobby of customizing older cars. alt.autos.karting for the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby, karting. rec.autos is intended to capture discussion on all other automotive topics. Crossposting: Crossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name is included on the Newsgroups: line in the article header; such articles will appear in all of the newsgroups listed. Crossposting is one of the most misunderstood and misused facilities on Usenet. You should only post to a group because you feel an article is appropriate; you should NEVER crosspost just to reach a particular audience. This distinction is subtle, but important. Radar Detector articles, for example, are more-or-less appropriate in rec.autos. They are almost never appropriate in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio, and the fact that you might want to reach the audience in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio is NOT adequate justification for posting to either group. Crossposting between any or all of the rec.autos.* groups is usually inappropriate; if you find yourself doing so, consider whether or not it is truly advisable, before sending your article. Consider setting Followup-To: to point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost. Crossposting between rec.autos.* and misc.consumers is chancy at best; in particular flame wars over the speed limit in the US and/or the use of radar detectors should NEVER be crossposted between any of these groups. Most readers of sci.electronics and rec.radio.* couldn\\'t care less about the police radar and radar detector arguments that go on endlessly in rec.autos. It is an excellent idea to check the Newsgroups: and Followup-to: lines of articles before posting a followup. In particular, be wary of posting to misc.test, rec.arts.startrek.*, or talk.bizarre, or any combination of these three. The life you save may be your own. There is a field in the header of any news article which allows you to (partially) control where the article goes; it is called the Distribution field. It may be very useful for many reasons; it should also serve as a reminder that news is a very large and widespread system. The distribution of rec.autos.* is fairly extensive. As of this writing, the Automotive newsgroups are known to reach most of Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and some locations in Japan. With this in mind, I offer the following hints about use of the Distribution: field in your article headers, and on article content. 1) Please take care not to send for-sale ads about clapped out Ford Mavericks in New Jersey to France or California; i doubt that anyone in either place will care, except for my girlfriend, who for some strange reason likes Mavericks (but only 4-door Mavericks, at that.) 2) When posting technical questions, please include the market for which your car was manufactured. For example, there are a number of differences between a European-market Ford Escort and a US-market Escort. Likewise, all 1750cc and early 2000cc Alfa Romeos reached the US with Spica Fuel injection; European market cars usually got carbs (often Webers). These differences can be important to your readers; make your situation clear. Failure to do so can lead to pointless flame wars and a significant spread of misinformation. 3) Be careful about your capacities and specifications when posting; in the US we get a mix of Metric and English system values, whereas Europe is almost entirely on the Metric system. A future edition of this monthly posting will contain a list of commonly-used abbreviations that may not be known in some places that rec.autos reaches; this cuts both ways so let us not be parochial about it. 4) Use the Distribution: field to limit where your article goes, when possible. Within North America, the values na (north america), can (canada), and usa may be used. in addition, the two-letter state abbreviations of the US are supported in some cases; e.g. if i wanted to send an article only to New York and New Jersey, i could put \"ny,nj\" in a Distribution field. note that multiple, comma-separated values are legal. these distribution fields vary widely, however, so you should check with your local sysadmin to find out what is likely to be supported in your area. The Dangers of Overgeneralization: To amplify a warning from the distribution section of this article: Be wary of making foolish assumptions about all cars, tires, etc. What is true for a 1973 Buick with a 455cid engine may be quite utterly wrong for a 1976 Honda with a 1200cc engine. Headlight laws in Sweden are decidedly different from those in Idaho. The Need for Adequate Specification: When you ask a question, please give a reasonable amount of information; e.g., if you have a question about your Honda, please specify year, model, engine size, etc. Otherwise, most answers to your question may be quite useless. Concerning Lemons: At one time or another, every auto manufacturer has manufactured a lemon or two; even Honda admits to this. Please don\\'t waste everyone\\'s time by announcing to the world that your `brand x\\' automobile is terrible, so all `brand x\\' automobiles are terrible, so no one should ever buy a car from the `brand x\\' company. Such articles are worse than useless, because they cause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little or no useful information. Concerning Flames: As much as we might wish it, a flame-free newsgroup is something that most likely will never occur. Here are some guidelines for flames and how to deal with them (a list of flame-prone topics follows in the next section of this posting): If you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory, don\\'t imagine for a minute that including the words `No Flames\\' will work. It won\\'t, and you\\'ll get exactly what you deserve. If you\\'re going to flame, you\\'re more likely to get away with it if you can cite a fact or maybe a well-known reference. No one is likely to believe bald, unsupported assertions. Be careful about who you choose to insult. Consider not insulting anyone. Asking the Question: It is a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like `Please send email, I don\\'t read this group\\'. It is a much better idea to end the question with `Please send email, if there is sufficient interest I\\'ll summarize the results in a later posting. I may miss posted responses to this request\\'. Answering the Question: If someone wants to hop up their Yugo, don\\'t tell them to get a Mustang. Either be silent, or give them useful advice. If someone wants advice on defending a speeding ticket, don\\'t tell them to obey the law next time -- it\\'s offensive, presumes guilt which is not proven, and doesn\\'t directly address the original question. In general, don\\'t post in order to see your words in print, and don\\'t post in order to enjoy feeling smug and self-righteous. Stale and/or Inflammatory Topics: Certain topics are considered stale by `old timers\\'; while discussion of them is certainly ok, and new, factual information is welcome, ravings about them are extremely tiresome, and may get the person who posts them ignored altogether. Some topics are naturally inflammatory; it is difficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of them. Some of these topics include the following: 1) the 55mph speed limit in the US: Pro and Con 2) discussions about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of radar detectors. 3) discussions over which radar detector is best. 4) discussions over what is a sports car (this is one reason why rec.autos.sport is not a `sports car\\' group -- everyone would argue about what constitutes a `sports car\\'.) 5) disputes over whether or not US Federal law protects the driver\\'s right to own and operate a radar detector 6) `Buy American\\' discussions 7) `clever\\' bumper stickers and personalized license plates 8) <insert nationality here> cars are terrible 9) What kind of car did Maxwell Smart drive? [when I have a complete, accurate answer it will be added to the commonly-asked questions article which is also posted monthly. Until then, please don\\'t waste bandwidth on this topic. -- rpw] Please direct comments and suggestions about this article to: welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com -- richard welty 518-393-7228 welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com ``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of a race car about either its pitch or roll axis\\'\\' -- Carroll Smith',\n",
       " \"Archive-name: rec-autos/part5 [this article is one of a pair of articles containing commonly asked automotive questions; the other article contains questions more geared to the automotive enthusiast, and so is not crossposted to misc.consumers. -- rpw] [changes as of 14 April 1993: revised brake fluid section, as non-silicone DOT-5 fluids are now apparently available -- rpw] Commonly Asked Automotive Questions Tire Questions: Q: What do the funny numbers on the sides of my tires mean? A: Typically, you will see something like 195/60HR14. the 195 is the overall width of the tire in millimeters, the tread is usually narrower. The 60 is the `aspect ratio'; it indicates the height of the sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width. Our example tire has a sidewall height of 0.60 * 195 ~= 117 mm. The 14 is the wheel diameter in inches; there are also some special tires called `TRX' tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations, like 390, which is in millimeters. The R means Radial, and the H is a speed rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire, when properly inflated and carrying an appropriate load, may safely operate. Common speed ratings are S (112MPH), T (118MPH), H (130MPH), and V (up to 150MPH.) Recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed rating to a different part of the designation; you may therefore find designations like 195/60R14 85H; the 85 indicates the per-tire load associated with the speed rating -- exceeding this load in continuous operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice. What follows is a table showing a number of `load indices' and corresponding maximum per-tire loads: Load Index 50 51 88 89 112 113 145 149 157 Max Load (Kg) 190 195 560 580 1120 1150 2900 3250 4125 Note that the usual mass vs. weight confusion occurs in this table. In some cases, the letters P or LT may be found in front of a tire size; the LT designation indicates Light Truck, and the P designation indicates Passenger car. If no letter is given, then the application of the tire is Passenger car usage. As far as I know, these letters only appear in the US market. The LT designation is prinicipally of interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles. For the owner of a passenger vehicle, there is no meaningful difference between a tire with a P designation and one with no designation at all. If the aspect ratio is omitted, it is probably 80, but may be 78. Tires with an MS (mud/snow) designation may have their speed rating reduced by 20 km/h (about 12mph.) There is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature, traction, and treadwear. Temperature and Traction are graded A, B, and C (with A the best and C the worst); treadwear is a numeric rating. These values are of limited value, as they are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires. Q: My car has tires with a funny size designation: 185/65HR390; can i put normal tires on the car? A: Your tires are called TRX tires; they were devised by Michelin. Because of a somewhat different bead design, they are incompatible with normal tires; Michelin used a different diameter wheel for them so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel (and so that more conventional tires could not be mounted on TRX type wheels.) You will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your car; it is barely possible to fit normal tires on TRX wheels, and horribly dangerous to do so (the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner, or possibly blow out at high speed.) TRX type tires are becoming hard to find; in addition to Michelin, Avon makes suitable tires. Goodyear has apparently discontinued their line of TRX tires. Q: Can I rotate radials from side to side, or rotate them only on one side of my car? A: Car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject; many say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a car is now ok (this group includes Michelin and Goodyear); others (for example, Pirelli and Nokia) will void warranties if such swapping is done. The best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before rotating your tires, and stick to the manufacturer's recommendations. Q: How many snow tires should I buy, and if I buy 2, which end of the car should I put them on? A: In short, 4, and both ends. To explain, many drivers in areas that don't get excessive snow or who don't drive agressively (or at all) in snow conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels, but there are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice. With a rear wheel drive car, you can choose between being able to start the car going (a function of the rear axle) or stopping and turning the car (a function of the front axle.) In a front wheel drive car, you start, stop, and turn with the front end. The primary risk of putting the snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes while going downhill, you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards. Radar Detectors and Speed Limits: Q: Why aren't there any comments on Radar Detectors and Speed Limits in this Q&A posting? A: Because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between misc.consumers and rec.autos.* always start long, tedious, and pointless flame wars. If you want to talk about either of these topics, please subscribe to rec.autos or alt.flame and keep it there. Safety Equipment: Q: Do airbags really work? A: Preliminary statistics suggest the following: Airbags work much better than no belts; good 3 point belts alone work much better than Airbags alone, and AirBags + 3 point belts work slightly better than 3 point belts alone. The con to airbags is that some designs tend to burn the driver's hands when venting the byproducts of the explosion that occurs inside the bag, and that some designs (but not all) may knock the driver's hands from the wheel, making retention of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult. Brake Questions: Q: Do I always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned? Midas always wants to do this. A: No. There are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing rotors; some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors more often than is strictly necessary. if the rotors are not warped warped, and only lightly grooved, then there is no need to replace or to turn them. Note also that some rotors (the rotors on many Hondas are a good example) are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical to turn them; they must be replaced when they become too thin, warped, or badly grooved. Q: They tell me I should downshift when braking to slow my car down. Is this really a good idea? A: It used to be a very good idea, back in the days of mediocre, fade prone drum brakes. In modern disc brake equipped cars, use of downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary, except in cases of long, steep downhill runs. Otherwise, modern disc brakes are more than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances, and they are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings. On the other hand, many standard driver's license tests in the USA still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking; I suggest that before taking a US driver's test, you either 1) learn to do this smoothly (which takes some time and practice) or 2) borrow a car with an automatic to take the test. Q: How often should I replace my brake fluid? A: Probably more often than you do. Traditional brake fluids tend to absorb water; this water can corrode internal parts of the brake system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid. DOT-3 type are older fluids; DOT-4 and DOT-5 are newer specifications. The principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points; the dry boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid, but the wet boiling point is important in older brake fluid. DOT-3 fluids have the lowest wet and dry boiling point _requirements_; DOT-4 fluids have better boiling point requirements; and DOT-5 fluids have the best boiling point requirements (but DOT-5 fluids are not clearly superior; see the next Q&A for more details.) While the requirements imply that DOT-4 fluids are better than DOT-3 fluids, there may be specific cases where a DOT-3 fluid is preferable, but these are mostly competition applications. Otherwise, DOT-4 type fluids offer _much_ improved brake pedal feel. Replacement once a year is recommended for DOT-4 fluids, although agressive drivers may profit by changing out fluid more frequently, or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid out of the brake calipers fairly regularly. Q: What about DOT-5 brake fluids? A: This breaks down in to two parts. The DOT-5 specification looks excellent for performance, but the first DOT-5 fluids were Silicone based. Silicone fluids are a tricky proposition. Unlike DOT-3 and DOT-4 fluids, they do not absorb water at all. While this may sound like a feature, the problem is that any water present pools up in such systems, interfering with braking performance and corroding any metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring. The water will tend to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers, where most of the corrosion occurs. Because of this phenomenon, it is essential when converting to Silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly beforehand; some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the brake system when converting to Silicone fluids. Two other issues that come up with silicone fluids: 1) they are difficult to pour cleanly (that is, without air bubbles), which interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel, and 2) while they generally have much higher boiling points than DOT-4 fluids, they do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable in effect from boiling DOT-4 fluids. SIlicone fluids may make sense in some street car applications, but they are certainly not recommended for high performance driving applications, and the economics are questionable for street use. I have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the DOT-5 standard that do not contain Silicones; these fluids appear to be reasonably compatible with the older DOT-3 and DOT-4 fluids, but I have little information at this time. Q: ABS is available on some of the cars I'm looking at, but it costs more. Is it worth it? A: This does not have a cut and dried answer; therefore, this answer will be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons. The short answer is that ABS costs more, both initially, and to maintain, will generally work better for the `average driver' (that is to say, a driver who does not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques), and may require the `unlearning' of some obsolete braking techniques like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case. Now for the long answer. ABS works by monitering the wheels of the car, looking for signs of locked brakes. It may or may not be able be able to distinguish between the different wheels (there are several systems on the market.) It cannot detect impending lockup (which is what you would really want in an ideal world), but only the existence of lockup. The sensors used vary; some of the less well designed sensors are sensitive to tire size, and to brake pad material, and may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original equipment or OE-equivalent components. When the sensors detect lockup, the ABS system responds by unlocking the brakes (either individually, or all at once, depending on the system.) If the driver keeps their foot firmly planted, the ABS will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states (if a sensor existed that could detect _impending lockup_, then we could sit right at that point, which is where maximum braking effect is achieved.) This pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal, as the system cycles. The percentage of the time that the brakes are truly engaged is called the `duty cycle'; typically in an ABS system this is about 40% On dry pavement, a trained driver can beat this duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking; on wet pavement, braking is so chancy that ABS will outperform threshold braking nearly every time. Unfortunately, on mud and on snow, often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes locked; only Audi, of the manufacturers producing ABS-equipped cars, has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the ABS system for this eventuality. A particularly important feature of ABS is that it preserves steering control. This is the case simply because, if you are braking near the limit and turn the wheel, the ABS will release the brakes if it sees steering-triggered lockup, and back off on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied. Braking distances will lengthen accordingly. An important caution: ABS cannot exceed the maximum theoretical braking force in any given situation; if you start sliding on glare ice, don't expect an ABS system to help you out very much. The coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an ABS system in your car. As far as maintenence goes, in addition to the potential restrictions I've listed above, you have to worry about the following: 1) parts costs are much higher; the OE master cylinder for my obscure european sedan lists for $185, but the OE master cylinder for the ABS-equipped version of the same car lists for over $1000. Most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of DOT-5 (silicone) brake fluids in ABS-equipped vehicles. Because of the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system components, regular (I suggest annual) replacement of brake fluid becomes very important. Q: What about this threshold braking business? A: [normally, I'd not put this in the consumers Q&A, but recent publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers in ABS-equipped Chevy Caprices suggests that this section is needed here -- rpw] Threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high performance drivers; if made a habit, it replaces the `stab the pedal and lock 'em up' panic habit entirely, and is much to be prefered. Basically, the premise is that tires generate maximum braking force when they have just started to slide, but just before the wheels lock up entirely. Drivers who threshold brake learn to feel what this `threshold' feels like, and learn to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake pedal. In many cars, you can feel that you are near the threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it. In any case, if you can't hear the tires whine just a bit, you're not very near the threshold. In a car with ABS, often there is a twinge in the pedal just before the system starts cycling; if the driver backs off on the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt, then they are very close to the threshold and they'll probably achieve better stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the ABS take over. Recently, there has been a rash of publicity over a number of accidents, and one death, involving police cars equipped with ABS systems. The police departments in question quickly blamed the new ABS systems, but according to Autoweek magazine, it now seems clear that the problem was a lack of training; none of the involved officers had any recent performance driving training. There is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing brake pedal by `pump braking', an old and discredited technique of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal, the goal being to try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system. If you think about it for a minute, you'll realize that pump braking must cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least 1/2, so if you cut the 40% duty cycle of an ABS system by that much, you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason. Threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective and useful technique regardless of whether your car has ABS; if you do fear a failed hydraulic system, then one or two stabs at the pedal will be sufficient. Gas Questions: Q: Does High Octane gasoline help? A: Maybe, maybe not. Some cars have knock sensors, and can adjust the engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used. On most cars, however, you should use the cheapest gas that makes your car run well. Check your owner's manual for details on what your car needs. Q: My car was made for leaded gasoline. Will unleaded gas hurt it? A: It is possible that unleaded gas may *slightly* increase valve wear, although the Amoco Oil company argues otherwise. The actual increase in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable, however, as modern leaded gasolines actually contain very little lead. You should, however, check your owner's manual; many cars from the early 1970s do not actually require leaded gasoline. Q: Do fuel treatments help? What kind should I use? A: Some do and some don't. During the winter, it is a good idea to use dry gas; however, some may be harmful to fuel injection systems. Never use an additive containing Methanol (sometimes called Methyl Alcohol); such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection. Manufacturer's opinions vary on additives containing Ethanol (sometimes called Ethyl Alcohol); if your car has fuel injection, check the owner's manual on your car before using these. Most manufacturers consider 10% Ethanol acceptable in gasoline. Additives with Isopropyl Alcohol (Isopropanol), and Petroleum Distillates are fine in fuel injected cars. An occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with fuel injectors, although many premium gasolines contain detergents that do the same job. Some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain Ethanol or Methanol; always check the ingredients before putting anything in your gas tank. There are a small number of particularly good additives; these are noticeably more expensive that the run-of-the-mill ones, but work much, much better. Among these are Chevron Techron, Redline SL-1, Wurth `Lubrimoly Ventil Sauber', and BG 44K. A bottle of one of these, once every six months, is highly recommended. Q: What about detergent gasolines? A: The quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat; BMW has instituted a testing program, and gasoline brands which pass this test may advertise that fact. Stickers indicating passage of the test are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations. If such gasolines are used, then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional. Beforewarned that while use of BMW approved gasolines will keep a clean engine clean, they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits. Lubrication Questions: Q: What do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean? A: There are several different items encoded. There is a two-letter code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer uses in the oil; this looks like SE,SF,CD or such. The S codes are for gasoline engine applications; the C codes are for diesel engine applications. The second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels of protection are developed; thus SF is considered better than SE, SE is considered better than SD, and so forth. The more noticeable designation is the oil weight. This is either a single number (e.g., 30 weight) or a pair of numbers separated by the letter W (e.g., 10W30.) The latter type is much more commonly used these days, and are the only type that most automobile manufacturers specify in operators manuals. The first number in the designation (10W) is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold; the W stands for `winter'. The second number (30) is the viscosity of the oil when hot. There is a trick here; the oil doesn't actually get thicker (turn from 10 weight to 30 weight) as it gets hotter. What is actually happening is that when the oil is cold, it has the viscosity of a cold 10 weight oil. as it gets hotter, it doesn't get thin as fast as a 10W oil would; by the time it is up to temperature, it has the viscosity of a hot 30 weight oil. Note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities; not all 10W oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold, and not all 30 weight oils have the same viscosity when hot. Note also that the novel behaviour of multi-grade oils is caused by additives, and it has been reported that with the sole exception of Castrol GTX, 10W40 oils do not retain their multi-grade characteristics well over time. 10W30, 15W40, and 20W50 oils work very well, though. Q: Are `quick lube' places any good? A: Some do adequate work, but there are quite a few incompetent ones out there. Let the buyer beware, watch them while they work, make sure that they don't overtorque the oil drain plug, and keep your hand on your wallet at all times. Q: Are oil additives like Slick-50 or Tufoil any good? A: Slick-50 and Tufoil are PTFE-based additives. Many of these have come onto the market recently; they are different from the moly-based additives that have been around since the early 50's. PTFE is the chemical name for Teflon(TM), a trademark owned by DuPont. In general, auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products. Most USENET responses to questions on these additives are favorable (slight increase of MPG after application, smoother revving) but long term results (whether PTFE additives are effective after 5K miles) are debatable. Some manufacturers (such as Saab) claim that either the product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage. Some BMW owners have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of Slick 50 to their cars. This writer has been cautioned by a Slick-50 Dealer (!) that Slick-50 should _not_ be used in Japanese motors, as it may clog the oil return passages in the engine. Otherwise, there are no known reports of damage caused by PTFE additives. On the other hand, there are satified Slick 50 customers in the world. Q: Do synthetic oils really work? A: Yes, but. More specifically, most auto manufactuers accept synthetics, but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by oil manufacturers. Auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your car. Even if you decide to try the longer intervals, at least change the oil filter at regular intervals, as synthetics get just as dirty as conventional oils. Synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter entirely; Amsoil, Redline, and AGIP are very highly regarded and very effective. Mobil 1 synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews, however. Q: Manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals. How often should I change my oil? A: It depends on how you drive. If your car always (or nearly always) gets warmed up, and you don't drive it very hard and keep the revs down, the manufacturer's recommendation is probably fine. If, however, you drive it hard, drive it at high revs, or alternatively, if you only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesn't get up to temperature, then you may wish to change oil much more often, perhaps at 3000 mile intervals (given that most manufacturers are now specifying 7500 mile intervals.) If you don't drive your car much at all (say 7500 miles a year), then you probably want to change oil every six months anyway. If you are storing a car during the winter, then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out of storage. Misc. Questions: Q: My car has a timing belt. I hear that bad things happen when they break. What's the story? A: It depends on the internal design of the motor. Early Ford Escorts, for example, will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks, but the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt. Some Honda motors will not be damaged, but others will be. If no replacement interval is specified for your car, then change the belt at least every 60,000 miles; some cars may require more frequent replacement. Ask your dealer or independent mechanic. Also, ask if there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time (for example, the same Ford Escorts that suffer valve damage also have a timing belt driven water pump, which has been known to seize, destroying the timing belt, and which then causes major valve damage as a side effect. Replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water pump can be a costly mistake.) Q: Why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it self destructs when the timing belt breaks? A: For performance reasons. Compromising piston design so that the valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression ratio of the engine be reduced significantly; this is why you are more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance oriented vehicles. Q: What causes Unintended Acceleration? A: The final report of the National Highway, Transportation, and Safety Administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the same time be consistent with the physical evidence. The NHTSA report goes on to conclude that `pedal misapplication' by the vehicle operator is probably the cause. -- richard welty 518-393-7228 welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com ``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of a race car about either its pitch or roll axis'' -- Carroll Smith\",\n",

       " \"I saw an interesting product in NY Auto Show, and would like to hear your comments. MILITECH(tm) is yet another oil additive. But the demonstration of this product really impressive, if it didn't cheat. The setup of the demo is fairly simple. A cone shaped rotor is half submerged in a small oil sink, filled with motor oil. The rotor is powered by an electronic motor. A metal pad is pressed against the rotor using the torque wrench until the rotor stopped by friction. The torque that is needed to stop rotor is read from the torque wrench. Before MILITECH was added, the rotor was stopped with about 60 lb-ft of torque (You pick the brand of oil, no difference). Once MILITECH was added to the oil, the rotor could not be stopped even with 120+ lb-ft of torque. Here is the good part: even after the salesman emptied the oil sink, you still could not stopped the rotor with the thin film remained on it. They say you need only add 2oz per quart of oil every 15k miles. A 16 oz bottle is $25. I still have my doubts. If this product is really so great, why it was so little known? The salesman said it is widely used in military. I didn't believe it. The demo was so impressive, that I bought a bottle against my common sense. Has anyone heard of or actually used this product? Is it real? If you are going to the auto show, please visit this stand on the second floor. See if can find out if the demo is a hoax or not. Jason Chen\",\n",

       " \"Archive-name: rec-autos/part4 [this article is one of a pair of articles containing commonly asked automotive questions; the other article contains questions of general consumer interest, and is broken out to facilitate crossposting to misc.consumers -- rpw] [last change: 8 February 1993; CT now permits radar detector usage, new tire-traction q&a -- rpw] Commonly Asked Questions Radar Questions: Q: Where are radar detectors illegal? A: In the US, currently Virgina and the District of Columbia prohibit all usage of radar detectors. New York prohibits their use in large trucks. In Canada, they are illegal in Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, Newfoundland and PEI (Prince Edward Island). They are apparently are illegal through most, if not all, of Europe. Legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other jurisdictions; chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal. Q: Where are Radar Detector Detectors used? Do they really work? A: Usage is spreading rapidly; initially they were used only in Canada, but now they are appearing in New York and Virginia. It is unsafe to assume that they are not in use in Connecticut and D.C. They work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently available super Het radar detectors; some brands of detector radiate more strongly than others, and are thus more likely to be spotted. New radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected by the current generation of detector detectors. Note that a detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned on. Q: What is VASCAR? Is it some kind of Radar? A: VASCAR is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and time-speed-distance computer. It depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target vehicle passes landmarks. No radar signals are emitted by a VASCAR system. Q: What is Ka band radar? Where is it used? Should a radar detector be able to handle it? A: Ka band has recently been made available by the FCC for use in the US in so-called photo-radar installations. In these installations, a low-powered beam is aimed across the road at a 45 degree angle to the direction of traffic, and a picture is taken of vehicles which the radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit. Tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle. Because of the low power and the 45 degree angle, many people believe that a radar detector cannot give reasonable warning of a Ka band radar unit, although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such capability anyway. The number of locales where photo-radar is in use is limited, and some question the legality of such units. Best advice: learn what photo radar units look like, and keep track of where they are used (or else, don't speed.) Q: Do radar jammers work? Are they legal? A: Quick answer: No, and Not in the USA. Detailed answer: Cheap radar jammers do not work well at all. Jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the military. Jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the Federal Communications Commission of the USA. Driving technique and Vehicle Dynamics Questions: Q: What are understeer and oversteer? A: Understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a car while cornering near the `limit' (limit of adhesion, that is.) Most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to be descriptive of the situations they encounter. Simply put, they tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner (steer `less', or `understeer') or it wants to turn more in a corner (`oversteer'.) Understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that untrained drivers, inadvertantly traveling too fast, won't get into trouble. Understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle in a corner. Oversteer is designed into some more performance oriented cars; it may be induced by lifting on the throttle (Trailing throttle oversteer, or TTO). In extreme cases, lifting on the throttle may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or spinning. Some technical details: in a corner at speed, the tires on the car will develop what are called `slip angles'; the slip angle is the angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to travel. In understeer, the front wheels have a greater slip angle than the rear wheels. In oversteer, the rear wheels have a greater slip angle than the front wheels. Q: What is a rev-matched downshift? A: When downshifting, the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear than it was in the higher gear. However, during a downshift, normally you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle, so the revs drop rather than increase. In rev-matched downshift, you blip the throttle before re-engaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to the new speed. This results in a much smoother and faster downshift. Q: What does heel-and-toe mean? A: Heel-and-toe is a technique used to do a rev-matched downshift while braking. This is normally challenging, because you need the right foot for both the brake and throttle. It is called heel-and-toe because you use one end of the foot on the brake, and the other on the throttle to match revs for the downshift. In many modern cars this is a misnomer; often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side on the throttle. Note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch, and just use the left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle, accomplishing the same thing. Q: What is double-clutch downshifting? A: While your right foot is doing the above, your left foot can do one of three things: nothing, declutch once, or declutch twice. The reason for declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the transmission to the speed of the engine. This is usually coupled with rev-matching, so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch engaged, the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission speed up. The procedure is as follows: (0) declutch (1) move gearshift lever to neutral (2) engage clutch (3) match revs (4) declutch (5) move gearshift lever to next lower gear (6) engage clutch This sounds like a lot of work, but with practice it becomes natural. The problem that double-clutching solves is normally the function of the synchronizers within the gearbox. In transmissions without synchros or with very worn synchros, double-clutching makes it much easier to shift. Basically, if you double-clutch well, you are not using the synchros at all. This is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good condition. Q: What do the numbers for acceleration from 0-60, 1/4 mile, skidpad, and slalom times in the Auto Magazines really mean? May they be compared? A: In short, 1) not as much as the magazines want you to believe, and 2) almost never. In more detail: the acceleration numbers (0-60mph and 1/4 mile times in the US) may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the same source. Testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine that comparing a Road & Track number to a Car & Driver number is quite pointless. Keep in mind, too, that the same variation applies from driver to driver on the street; the driver is a major (often *the* major) part of the equation. Skidpads vary, and even if they didn't, skidpad figures are really only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires; they change radically when tire compounds change. DO NOT make any assumptions about the comparative handling of, say, two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers. This is not to suggest that skidpads are without value, however. Skidpads are an excellent educational tool at driving schools. They are simply of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires. Slalom times are slightly more useful; they test some small parts of the automobile's transient response. However, they are also heavily influenced by the stock rubber on the car, and they do not test many corners of the car's envelope. They DO NOT tell you all you need to know before making a buying decision. For example, they don't tell you what the rear end of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes off-camber. When a car has an adjustable suspension, these tests are usually done in the `sport' setting, which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving. The list of caveats could go on for page after page. Q: My buddy claims that wide tires don't make any difference, according to his freshman physics textbook, and that you can't ever accelerate or corner at more than 1.0G. Does he know what he's talking about? A: 1) in short: he hasn't got a clue. 2) in more detail: the equations for friction used in freshman physics textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth, dry and non-deformable, none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating temperature. Pavement is _never_ smooth; it is always irregular to a greater or lesser extent. Tires, which are not really dry and solid (as rubber is a substance which in its natural form is liquid, and which has only been coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic), deform to match the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over. In a tire at operating temperature, grip is actually generated by shear stresses inside the deformed rubber, and not by anything even remotely resembling friction in the freshman physics sense of the term. The colder a tire is relative to its operating temperature, the closer its behaviour will be to the traditional concept of friction; if much hotter than the its proper operating temperature, the more likely the possibility of some part of the tire actually ``reverting'' to liquid, which is mostly like to happen deep in the tread, causing characteristic blisters and chunking. (This latter, though, is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal street driving, so unless you're a competition driver or do a lot of high speed track driving, don't worry about it.) Because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction, it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all; thus dragsters accelerate at more than 1.0G and race cars corner and brake at more than 1.0G. Because simple friction does not apply, it is actually possible for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of grip. An actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques such as Finite Element Analysis, due to the complexity of the mechanism. Misc. Questions: Q: What does <name or acronym> stand for? A: Here is a list of some of the names which are commonly asked about; be careful in soliciting the meanings of other names as misinformation abounds on the net. In particular, NEVER ask in rec.humor if you want a useful result. Saab: Svenska Aeroplan A. B., or The Swedish Airplane Corporation Alfa: Societa Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili, or The Lombardy Automobile Manufacturing Company Fiat: Fabbrica Italiana di Automobili Torino, or The Italian Automobile Manufacturers of Turin BMW: Bayerische Motoren Werke, or Bavarian Motor Works MG: Morris Garage Q: Does VW own Porsche? A: No. Porsche is a publicly held company, controlled by the Porsche and Piech families. Porsche has extensive business dealings with VW/Audi, which causes some confusion. Since currently Porsche is in some financial difficulty, there is a possibility that Mercedes or VW may be interested in purchasing the company in the near future, but this is only speculation at this time. -- richard welty 518-393-7228 welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com ``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of a race car about either its pitch or roll axis'' -- Carroll Smith\",\n",
       " 'Archive-Name: rec-autos/part6 [New article as of 4 February 1993 -- rpw] Many people want to set up mailing lists for their favorite automotive topics; rather fewer know how to do it. This article will provide the essential information for doing so on standard Unix systems. A shell script and examples of alias file setups are included which presently run on a Sparc 2 here at balltown.cma.com for a number of mailing lists. Note that if you do set up an automotive mailing list, please let me know of the -request address so that I can list it in the montly rec.autos posting. Also inform the keeper of the Usenet list-of-lists (check news.answers for this monthly posting.) First of all, to get anywhere, you need to either 1) be a sysadmin, or 2) have some measure of assistance from your sysadmin. It is also important that you have reasonably good network connectivity; if it seems like you get everything several days after anyone else, or that you have trouble getting email through, then your network connectivity is probably not good enough. Listserv: There is a handy automated mailing list package named listserv, which is available from several ftp servers on the network. Details of the installation and operation of listserv are beyond the scope of this article, but anyone who is considering running a large mailing list should probably look at listserv carefully. The Alias file: On a typical unix system; there is a file named /usr/lib/aliases on whichever file server is your mail host; it contains lines such as: foo: bar, baz, bletch which means that any email sent the name `foo\\' on that host is redistributed to users bar, baz, and bletch. thus, the simplest possible email list is my-favorite-car: member1, member2, member3, my-address my-favorite-car-request: my-address this has a couple of problems; the most noticeable one being that you have to be superuser to edit the alias file. however, you can do the following, with the connivance of your sysadmin: my-favorite-car: :include:/home/mydir/misc/autos/my-favorite-car-list my-favorite-car-request: my-address Where the file specified is a list of comma and newline separated addresses. This file can be in the list admin\\'s home directory, owned by the list admin. Bounced Mail: this still has a problem; bounced mail usually gets distributed to all the members of the list, which is generally considered somewhat irritating. Therefore, the way that the driving school mailing list is set up is instructive (Thanks to harpal chohan of the bmw list for this setup, by the way. I\\'m not sure where he got it from.) school-request: welty school-rebroadcast: :include:/home/newwelty/misc/autos/school/list school: \"|/usr/local/adm/bin/explscript school\" owner-school: school-request owner-school-out: school-request here\\'s what is going on here: the owner- and -request addresses are intended as traps for bounced mail coming from the network. the -request address also serves as the point of contact for administrative duties. school is what people send mail to; instead of pointing at addresses, it points at a shell script which rewrites headers before resending the email. school-broadcast (of which nobody except me knows the name; the name has been changed here to protect my own sanity) points at the actual list members. the shell script i use is as follows: ----------------- #!/bin/sh cd /tmp sed -e \\'/^Reply-To:/d\\' -e \\'/^Sender:/d\\' -e \\'/^From /d\\' | \\\\ (echo Reply-To: ${1}@balltown.cma.com; \\\\ echo Errors-To: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \\\\ echo Sender: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \\\\ cat -) | \\\\ /usr/lib/sendmail -om -f ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com \\\\ -F \"The ${1} Mailing List\" ${1}-rebroadcast exit 0 ------------------- note that this script does not know the name of the list; the name is passed in from outside, so that the script may be used for multiple lists (i run several out of this site.) the script excises Reply-To:, Sender:, and From lines from the incoming message, substitutes for Sender: and Reply-To:, and adds Errors-to: 99.9% of all email bounce messages end up being sent to the -request or owner- addresses if this header rewrite is done. For digested lists, there is some digestification software around. Hopefully I\\'ll be able to provide more information in a future version of this posting. richard welty (welty@balltown.cma.com) -- richard welty 518-393-7228 welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com ``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of a race car about either its pitch or roll axis\\'\\' -- Carroll Smith',\n",

The glossy brochure showed how these front mounted backup lights were useful for illuminating hazards (pot holes, kid\\'s toys, etc) that would be run over by the front of the car if you had the wheels turned while backing up.

I stated that I would not block a would-be passer. I would not block a would-be passer \"for their own good\" or for any reason other than I was prevented from doing so due to the traffic circumstance. I fail to see how deterring a passer under these circumstance would IN ANY WAY decrease YOUR chances of being involved in an accident, fatal or otherwise. In fact, I could imagine how blocking a would-be passer would actually INCREASE your chances of being \"offed\" or involved in an accident, especially if this \"passer\" is riding your bumper. Intentionally blocking a person riding your bumper is certainly NOT a \"wise driving practice\", it only causes the jam to become more congested. I don\\'t mess with trucks and I actually watch the road ahead AND the road behind! If I perceive that I am rapidly closing on a \"pack\" of vehicles, I try to avoid getting caught up in situation such as you decribe. Usually either traffic is just building and I have to deal with this fact of life, or I wait to a slow passer to complete their pass and make way for the pack to clear. If someone decides then to pull up on my bumper, I signal my intention to move to the right, and do so at the first opportunity (& hope they will open the jam). I feel this is not only courteous driving, but ALOT safer than the actions you advocate!!! There are actually many courteous drivers on the road who do not intentionally impede others. If someone in front of me seems to be oblivious to the fact that they are blocking traffic I use my blinker or flash my lights, or, if all else fails, will briefly speed up /slow down so they MIGHT get the message that I am a faster vehicle trying to pass. I feel it is never safe to ride anyone\\'s bumper. IF someone is intentionally blocking traffic, because they feel that it is civil duty or philosophic duty or for some unfathomable reason, I feel they deserve, at the very least, derision.

This is with religious attention to maintenance such as oil changes etc. Both cars were driven in exactly the same manner.. 1.

A rod bearing went out on the No. 1 piston seriously damaging the crankshaft, contaminating the engine etc. When the overhaul was done last week it required new crankshaft, one new cam shaft (has two) because the camshaft shattered when they tried to mill it.

In the old days such behaviour would be rewarded with a whipping with a good-sized belt, and then taken into some hospital to see first hand what kind of damage such accidents cause. Of course this doesn\\'t happen any more. That whipping would probably save the kid\\'s life by teaching him some respect for others. A person with that little respect would inevitably wind up dead early anyway. The problem is creeping gradualism. If you put a frog into hot water, he just jumps out. But if you put him into cold water and then ever-so- gradually heat it, the frog will cook. This is what the entertainment industry and lack of religious, moral, and educational standards in our modern North American society have done to us over the years. Now that we are about to be \\'cooked\\', we may have woken up too late. #> #>Erik velapold # #Society, as we have known it, it coming apart at the seams! The basic reason #is that human life has been devalued to the point were killing someone is #\"No Big Deal\". Kid\\'s see hundreds on murderous acts on TV, we can abort #children on demand, and kill the sick and old at will. So why be surprised #when some kids drop 20 lbs rocks and kill people. They don\\'t care because the #message they hear is \"Life is Cheap\"! And the education system and the Religious Leaders aren\\'t doing much about it, either. With both parents working in this society, where is the stabilizing influence at home? Latchkey children are everywhere! And these latchkey kids can watch whatever rotten videos and listen to whatever violent hate-promoting \"music\" and videos they like because no one is home to stop it. This day and age, when there is about 100 times more things to learn than when I went to school, our answer to this increased knowledge is shorter school hours and more leisure time! I say keep the kids in school longer, feed them good food and teach them something, and when they get home, have a parent there to interact and monitor them. There is a very old and now forgotten proverb: a child left on his own will bring a parent to grief. Daycare systems are not the answer.

Here\\'s a summary of the replies I received. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I\\'m not under 25 anymore (but is 27 close enough). 1992 Dodge Stealth RT/Twin Turbo (300hp model). No tickets, no accidents, own a house, have taken defensive driving 1, airbag, abs, security alarm, single. $1500/year $500 decut. State Farm Insurance (this includes the additional $100 for the $1,000,000 umbrella policy over my car and house) The base policy is the standard $100,000 - $100,000 - $300,000 policy required in DE. After 2nd defensive driving course it will be 5% less. I bought the car in September 1992. The company I was with (never had and accident or ticket in 11 years) quoted me $2,500. Hope this helps.

You take away all he has and all he\\'s ever gonna have.\" --Will Munny, \"Unforgiven\" ======================================================================== 61 I am beyond the \"under 25\" age group, but I have an experience a few years ago that might be interesting to you. I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica GT. I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car. Front runners included the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years). I narrowed it down to those two. I liked the simplicity and handling (and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche. The Supra Turbo was less money and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury car. It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924. I was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i decided to stop by my insurance agent\\'s office on the way. I asked about what would happen to my rate with either car. \"If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as the Celica (the \\'85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that year was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because the car will be 2 years newer. Our lower-risk division will continue to handle your account. \"If you buy the Porsche 924, we\\'ll have to change you to the standard [higher] rate company and your rate will double. And if you go with a 944, it\\'s another story again - we\\'ll cover the rest of this year, but cancel you after that.\" \"But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually faster than the [standard] 944. That doens\\'t make sense.\" That\\'s what the book says. We don\\'t insure Corvettes, either. For some reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers - as very traditional and conservative.\" I eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons. The Porsche dealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure guy in the back room. At equal monthly payments, it would have taken a year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance. I concluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto theft. /|/| /||)|/ /~ /\\\\| |\\\\|)[~|)/~ | Everyone\\'s entitled to MY opinion. / | |/ ||\\\\|\\\\ \\\\_|\\\\/|_|/|)[_|\\\\\\\\_| | goldberg@oasys.dt.navy.mil ========Imagination is more important than knowledge. - Albert Einstein======= ======================================================================== 32 I live in Idaho.

       " 'an excellent automatic can be found in the subaru legacy. it switches to \"sport\" mode when the electronics figure it, not when the driver sets the switch.. which is the proper way to do it, IMO. so what does \"sport\" mode entail? several things: 1) revving to red line (or to the rev limiter in the case of the legacy) 2) delayed upshifts. (i.e. if you lift off briefly, it will remain in the low gear. this is handy if you are charging through corners and would like to do without the distraction of upshifts when there\\'s another curve approaching) 3) part throttle downshifts, based on the *speed* at which the pedal is depressed, rather than the *position* of the pedal. modern electronics can measure this very easily and switch to sport mode. this is wonderful if you want to charge through a green light about to turn red. my audi senses this very well and can downshift on as little as half throttle if my right foot is fast enough. also, i think that a smart automatic can deliver better gas mileage than a dumb driver with a stick, all else being equal.. remember that the idea of a stick being more economical than an automatic makes a big assumption that the driver is smart enough to know what gear to use for each situation.. how many times have you ridden with an inattentive driver cruising on the highway at 55/65 in 4th gear (of a 5 speed)? how many % of people who drive manuals *really* know what the best gear to use is for every conceivable situation? i\\'m sure there will be some who know, but i suspect that a chip controlled automatic with all possible scenario/ratio combinations stored in ROM is likely to do better. i can also say that all my previous assumptions were proved wrong after i got a car with instantaneous mpg readout... high gear, low revs and wide open throttle is more economical than low gear, high revs and small throttle opening. the explanation is quite simple if one sits down to think about it, but not that obvious at first sight. eliot',\n",

       " \"In rec.autos you write: >if ayrton senna can drive a racecar with fully automatic transmission, >it can't be half bad.. :-) This McLaren auto-transmission (I still think it's only half auto, but You may be right) has NOTHING to do with Your GM, Chrysler, Volvo, or whatever auto transmission. It's a normal manual transmission gearbox with clutch and all, but there are servo motors, which do the shifting. That means, there is no power loss in the drivetrain (if You take out minimal mechanical friction), and the sami-auto transmissions (Ferrari, Williams, McLaren(?),...) don't tell You, when to shift, either. However, these transmissions share an important disadvantage with Your stock auto-trannie: They are EXPENSIVE. As long as these servo-shifted gearboxes aren't available on 'normal' cars I'm gonna stick with my manual. I just can't see an advantage to make up for two grand I lose in this deal and the loss in mileage and power (except maybe in real heavy traffic). But then I drive mostly on the autobahn and country roads anyway.

I was raised by a pack of wild corn dogs. We here are *VERY* interested in info on R12 substitutes (in fact I think we really need all the info on this we can get). I would really appreciate technical, supply, and hardware-upgrade details. Also, R12 is a useful solvent/reagent in the extraction/production of certain pharmaceuticals. Any info on the substitutes' corresponding usefullness? I am currently working with the local engineers who are making sure we are compliant with the regulations. The trouble with regulations is that they only tell you what you are no longer permitted to do, not what you should do instead. I think the cause of the new regulations is the Montreal Protocol which has a definite CFC-phase-out schedule. (Of course the cause of the Montreal Protocol was all the research done on the causes of the Ozone Depletion Problem.) Someone asked earlier about why the governments were working so fast to ban the ozone-depleting (CFC) chemicals and not gasolines and other greenhouse-gas-producing compounds. The greenhouse effect (produced by infrared-trapping gasses like CO2 and methane) and the ozone-hole problem (produced by long-lived, chlorine-containing molecules) are not the same thing. It is a lot easier to do something about not using the CFC's (chloro-fluorocarbons) than it is to stop producing CO2 and methane which are natural byproducts of combustion and of living (animal) organisms. Planting more trees and not destroying so many existing trees would help the greenhouse-gas problem, but would do nothing for the ozone problem. Fred W.

First is that the way the sun was shining in Miami, it had a summer atmosphere in early spring for baseball. In comparison Wrigley Field in early April still has a wintry look to it with the dead ivy and bundled up fans. The second and most important was the fans. I like these guys/gals! I will admit I am a football fan first but I still enjoy baseball. It was interesting because most of these fans are only accustomed to the Miami Dolphins. The way they were cheering, I thought it was the AFC playoffs. Of course opening day may have A LOT to do with it, but I really got feeling of electricity that I think is lacking with a lot of baseball fans in other cities. Baseball certainly needs a charge and I hope these two expansion teams bring back some excitement. We'll find out Friday how Denver Bronco fans respond. Phillies are 2-0!

Only 120,000 dollar cars should be driven fast. >They drive goddamn Rabbits at 120 MPH in Europe, pal, and I reckon >a Taurus is at least as capable as a Rabbit. My whole point was not to say that the cars *couldn\\'t* go that fast, but that they *shouldn\\'t* go that fast. A family sedan designed to be operable at 85mph doesn\\'t suddenly become operable at 130mph because you added some plastic aero effects, slightly wider tires, and a much larger engine. That\\'s what the SHO is -- a slightly modified family sedan with a powerful engine. They didn\\'t even bother improving the *brakes.* The Mustang is essentially the same deal as the SHO -- a big power plant stuck in a mid-size sedan, with almost no other modifications. I have real-life experience with the Mustang -- it handles like a brick (except when you\\'re invoking oversteer, of course, something I personally avoid doing on the highway) and stopping power is inadequate even from 80mph. Lots of accelleration -- but the rest of the car is not up to par. I picked the Porsche example because they are designed with speed in mind. It didn\\'t have to be the 911 -- it could have been the much cheaper 944 or one of several Mercedes or Audi models. All of these cars are fairly expensive -- but so are the parts that make them drivable at high speed. This should be elementary. There are a few things to keep in mind about Europe, since you brought it up. My Autobahn knowledge is admittedly second-hand, but I believe the following to be true: 1. Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are here. 2. The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed than they are here, and usually include animal fences. This makes them far more predictable than most US highways. 3. Not all of Europe is the Autobahn. Most places in Europe have speed limits that aren\\'t out-of-line with what we used to have in the US -- if my friends weren\\'t lying to me they\\'re typically not much higher than 120km/h. I strongly suspect you won\\'t find a lot of Rabbit owners doing 120mph (nearly 200km/h) on the Autobahn, but I could be wrong. Some people have no respect for their own lives. >>You certainly haven\\'t convinced me. > Of course not. \"Speeding-is-bad. Speeding-is-illegal. >I-will-not-speed.

There are two very long entry ramps which all the hurry-up yahoos dive into cause they want to get ahead. When we get to the point where these ramps merge, all hell breaks lose. The result is that traffic which was moving at 55 on the VA side of the bridge, stalls on t\\'other side.

When a friend of mine went shopping for a small sedan a few years ago, she brought me along as a token male so the salespeople wouldn\\'t give her the \"bimbo\" treatment. Her first choice was a Mazda 323, and second choice was a Nissan Sentra. We went to a Mazda dealership and described what \"we\" wanted. We started negotiating on the price, and the salesdroid kept playing the \"let me run this price by the sales manager\". After playing the \"good salesman, bad salesman\" game, we finally told him that if he didn\\'t have the authority to negotiate a price, perhaps we should be speaking directly to someone who did. He brought in the sales manager who proceeded to dick us around with every trick in the book. (Read Remar Sutton\\'s \"Don\\'t Get Taken Every Time\" for a list.) Finally, after playing a few more rounds of \"you\\'ll have to work with us on this price\", also known as \"each time you come up a thousand dollars we\\'ll come down ten\", the salesmanager gave a signal to his two sales cronies, stood up, and said \"well, we can\\'t come down any more so I guess we can\\'t help you\" and they trouped out of the room, leaving us sitting in the salesman\\'s office all by ourselves. Hmm. I\\'d read that sleazy salesmen sometimes bug their own offices so they can leave and listen in on couples discussing the sales offer, and I mentioned this aloud to my friend while we were sitting there wondering why they would leave us in the office instead of showing us to the door. For lack of anything better to do, I picked up the phone on the desk and called another Mazda dealership, asked for a salesman, and began discussing what kind of price they would consider. A few sentences into the conversation, Mr. Salesmanager broke into the line (!) and began telling me how rude he thought it was that I would call another dealership from \"his\" phone! I said that since he\\'d announced that our business was over, he shouldn\\'t care, and every time I tried to talk to the other sales guy the sales manager would drown out our voices with his own. (How did he know that I was using the phone, anyway?) Finally, I hung up and we headed out of the showroom. Sales manager and cronies come out of a little unmarked room and he begins to berate us again. We say that we won\\'t bother him anymore, we\\'re going next door to the Nissan dealership. Then comes the part I wish I could have videotaped. As we go out the front door, the sales manager SHOUTS across the entire showroom, customers and all, \"Go ahead! You DESERVE to buy a Nissan!\" So my friend bought a Sentra. Just so the guilty won\\'t go unpunished, I\\'ll mention that the sales manager\\'s name was Gary Tusone. From his manner, his refusal to come down to a reasonable price, and his anger at the end, my guess is that he had bet our original salesman (who was a young novice) that he\\'d be able to get at least X dollars out of us, and he was steamed that we wouldn\\'t fall for his slimy tricks.',\n",

Stuff deleted... I am sorry to report that in Southern California it was a sick sport for a while to drop concrete blocks from the overpasses onto the freeway. Several persons were killed when said blocks came through their windshields. Many overpass bridges are now fenced, and they have made it illegal to loiter on such bridges (as if that would stop such people). Yet many bridges are NOT fenced. I always look up at a bridge while I still have time to take evasive action even though this *sport* has not reached us here in Fresno. ___________________________________________________________________ Greg_Lewis@csufresno.edu Photojournalism sequence, Department of Journalism CSU Fresno, Fresno, CA 93740',\n",

       " 'Hi, maybe someone can help me here... I am looking to buy this 1990 Nissan Maxima GXE for CDN$14000 right now. The car has 96000 km (or about 60000 miles) on it. A typical mileage for 1990 cars seem to be about 70000 km (or about 43K mi). The seller just informed me that when he brought the car in for certification he was told that the front break pads and the exhausts had to be replaced to meet the legal standards. (He said he will replace the components before selling the car to me.) Being copmletely ignorant to the technical stuff on cars, I don\\'t know what this could mean... Is 96K km about the time typical for replacing the above mentioned items? Or is this an indication that the car was abused? Would other things break down or have to be replaced soon? The seller told me that he used the car on the highway a lot, but, I don\\'t know how to verify this... I\\'ve seen the paint chipped away in tiny dots in the front edge of the hood, though. Although the Maxima is an excellent car and the car is very clean and well kept, it\\'s currently out of warranty (a similarly priced \\'90 Accord with 70K km will have 2 years or 30K km worth of warranty left) and I don\\'t want to worry about paying for any repair bills...

I'm no mustang head, but don't the early ones have a simple strut suspension (that is, with no upper A-arm)? Just a strut going down to a lower control arm (single bushing: not an A-arm), with a tension/compression rod locating it in the forward/backward direction? Anyway, simple strut suspensions like this can be lowered just by using shorter springs, cutting the springs, lowering the spring perch or shortening the strut below the perch. In each of these cases, the suspension geometry will suffer because the lower control arms will not be at the intended angle. A spacer placed between control arm and the bottom of the strut (roughly the height of the reduction) will restore the suspension geometry. IMHO, the kit that includes the spacer is the only way to go... --Ken -- Ken R.

My Autobahn knowledge is admittedly second-hand, but I believe >the following to be true: My knowledge about driving in the U.S. is also second-hand, but I think I can correct your statements about our Autobahn: >1. Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are here. Oh yeah, that would be paradise... in fact, you can forget it. From all I\\'ve heard from my U.S. relatives, drivers esp. here in Germany are much more agg- ressive, but not disciplined. One of my relatives, a L.A. resident, hired a car at the Nuernberg airport and went about 18 miles to our home. He said then that he grew about 1 year older during this ride and swore he\\'d never drive a car in Germany again (this was in 1982 and he kept his promise - the situation now is even worse as effect of the increased volume of traffic). What you mean by `better disciplined\\' should perhaps be considered `cautious due to fear\\': When driving around here, you always *have* to take into consideration that the majority of the other drivers absolutely relies on you: They expect that nobody fails or sleeps; many of them exploit this by driving as fast as their car can go (of course only where that is allowed, you might think - dream on :). So any mistake you make is a very high risk to your health - and if you\\'re ex- posed to such a situation from your very first day as a driver, you learn to handle it - or you lose... That\\'s the way I and most people I know experience our traffic situation - whether you think this is pleasant or efficient is up to you; I think we handle a very high volume of traffic and that at high speeds with modest (compared to the volume) and decreasing rates of lethal accidents - OTOH, more and more people (esp. women) dislike driving (because they feel overtaxed and threatened) and each accident is one accident too much. >2. The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed than > they are here, and usually include animal fences. This makes them > far more predictable than most US highways. Better designed and maintained, may be - but animal fences are very rare. Auto- bahnen and many other streets have guard-rails (I hope that\\'s the right word - a plank made from thick steel sheet fixed on uprights; it\\'s about 2 feet high); those guard-rails are designed for keeping vehicles on the road. Smaller animals can crawl under the plank, bigger ones can easily jump over it. The point is that esp. larger animals are very rare in Germany; they tend also to be very timid. Accidents caused by animals are a neglegible danger. >3. Not all of Europe is the Autobahn. Most places in Europe have > speed limits that aren\\'t out-of-line with what we used to have in > the US -- if my friends weren\\'t lying to me they\\'re typically not > much higher than 120km/h. You\\'re right (there are speed linits even on the major part of the Autobahn) - but the attitude towards driving (see above) seems to be very similar to that in Germany (I\\'ve been in France, Switzerland, Italy, Austria, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands) - besides that, you really can\\'t rely on the residents abiding the local speed limits. I\\'ve got quite a lot of practise (~120k miles) and I\\'m used to travel at 130 mph (FYI, with a car even smaller than a rabbit), but I consider driving on the highways round Paris or Milano really a thrill... >I strongly suspect you won\\'t find a lot of Rabbit owners doing 120mph >(nearly 200km/h) on the Autobahn, but I could be wrong. ... Sorry, but you\\'ll find quite a lot rabbit-class-car (or even smaller, mine is a Peugeot 205) owners going that fast; small cars with much HP are very `hip\\' over here - and most people buying such cars aren\\'t afraid to let them run. > ... Some people >have no respect for their own lives. I disagree; the size or weight of a car is rather irrelevant. Formula-1 cars weigh less than 700 kg and the drivers have a chance to survive accidents at 130 mph or higher - OTOH when crashing against a solid object at 130 mph, it makes no difference whether you sit in a Porsche, a Mercedes, a tank or on a bicycle: Your\\'re dead.

I haven\\'t had any real trouble with this car outside of a CV joint boot that was leaking, but the dealer took care of that promptly, and even gave me a free rental car for the day and a half that I was without my car. I was quite happy with the way they handled...especially considering that I was expecting the worst from them! From what I\\'ve heard, it sounds like Ford/Mazda had some QC problems with the Probe (and probably MX-6) when they first went into production, but I think these problems have mostly been corrected at this point.

At the same It seems sad that people lose all perspective when they here about a case of violence by teenagers... For a little perspective: How about the thousands of kind teenagers who volunteer at local agencies to help children, seniors, the homeless? Did you read about all the kids at Stanford who spent their spring breaks helping out in inner city areas? What about the hundreds of volunteers ( teenagers and others) who worked to clean up the mess after the Rodney King riots in LA? Have you gone to your local high school play recently? Attended the school orchestra performances? Have you seen how many kids volunteer to pick up trash, plant trees, do walk-a-thons? How many kids have tried to sell you stuff to benefit organizations they belong to? How many girl scout cookies have you bought? How many chocolate bars for good causes? The media picks up on all the anomalies, the sensational... What about the wonderful teenagers all over the place who work hard at school, get good grades, go to college (or to work) and make a real contribution to our society? All humans are teenagers at some time in their lives! Mother Theresa was a teenager and so was Geoffrey Dahmer.

That is a question that can only be answered by yourself and where you live. If you live in a place where crime is apparent, then it might be a good idea to get one simply as a deterrent. However, if a professional thief wants your vehicle, its as good as gone no matter what you do. But to slow down any thieves it would be a good idea to get the basic options. That would be: 1) ignition kill or fuel cut-off 2) a flashing red LED These two are basic to a decent alarm system. To slow down the criminal some more, get a steering wheel lock. That should be sufficient to persuade the thief to find an easier target. But, then there's always car-jacking. Why is life so confusing?

It has a 2 liter carburated engine in it, and no blipping of the throttle would cause the idle to drop back to normal (I don't think the linkage is stuck). What can I do to fix this problem? This has been a problem from time to time, but has straightened itself out - until now. I don't have a tach, but by gauging by the sound of the engine, it is idling about twice as fast as it should be. This is down from what it was idling at when I pulled up at a stop light.

While I don\\'t read normally read this group, I was looking for Valentine radar information (sigh, maybe in the FAQ) and came across your posting.. I bought a \\'93 Probe GT with the PEP 263A last July (now at 9500 miles) after debating over the Sentra SE-R/NX2000, MX6, MR-2, Stealth, Prelude, and Celica. Check this month\\'s Consumer Reports for previous Probe records. My criteria: a \"fun\" car with ABS, airbag, over 130hp, and less than $25K. I thought about a turbo, but checking with insurance people ruled that out. The Tri-Star cars (Eclipse/Talon/etc) were out since they don\\'t have an air bag. Ditto for the Mustang(also no ABS). The SE-R/NX2000/M20 fell into the pocket-rocket category. A good used car buy. The MX-6 was almost there but rolled more than I liked. I didn\\'t like the Prelude dash/instrumentation at all. Too weird for me. The MR2 has a much smaller non-passenger space than I needed, so out that went. The Celica was \"ok\" but underpowered when loaded with options (and somewhat overpriced too) in non-turbo form. I never considered the 240SX since it didn\\'t have an airbag. I did look at it for its RWD virtues but that\\'s it. The Corolla never entered my mind. I should have looked at the Mitsubishi VR4/Dodge Stealth more. Since my list was exhausted, I bought the Probe. :-) The car design is different than earlier years, so it\\'s too early to see its reliability so far. For what it\\'s worth, my comments: My dislikes: Shutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal. Headlights have \"stuck\" up a few times (weather?) air conditioning broke ~4000 miles (pressure cycling switch) condensation around rear washer fluid container doesn\\'t drain completely. crammed engine; little hope for do-it-yourselfers (typical) parts somewhat more expensive than normal Ford parts underside plastic doesn\\'t like sharp driveways and speedbumps (typical). assembly gripes: tape on radiator, screw fell out of dash, seat seams not stitched properly. Hopefully just a fluke. Ford only gives 1 key with the car. C\\'mon Ford, spend an extra few pennies! Rear hatch has no padding on corners when up. I\\'m waiting for the day when I bash my head on the corner. horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center (personal preference) Tires fling dirt/mud onto side of car My Likes: engine (design/valves/sounds/smoothness/power/mileage/torque) -- definitely #1 handling (very good for FWD; understeer only at limits) transmission (the 5 speed is a must) usable instrumentation (lovely readable analog everywhere) Very little torque steer at full power (much better than the \\'90 SHO I drive) stability at 100+mph (high gearing though) low cowl (good visibility in front) Heated outside mirrors (nice in fog, never tested in freezing weather) ABS/Air bag (see above) rear seats fold down (I have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important) No shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes (still!) Tires: 225/55VR16 Goodyear Eagles (70% left; hoping for 30K :-) As you can see, I\\'m primarily interested in the engine. While it doesn\\'t have the uummmph of a big-liter car or the turbo rush, the big selling point for me was the all-aluminum 24 value 2.5 liter engine. The overall car is a good buy for the money. That market segment hasn\\'t changed much since July (Prelude VTEC, Honda Del Sol??). I drive it to and from work each day on relatively smooth roads, and most noticable thing is that the Probe\\'s suspension doesn\\'t like potholes. When you test drive one, find a potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable. If you have 3+ passengers, by all means bring them along too. They\\'ll find that they have no room in the back and you\\'ll find that the car rides differently (if that\\'s \"better\" is up to you). Also, there\\'s a lot of glass around you which I wasn\\'t expecting; the temperature inside the car gets pretty hot in the summer. My back seat passengers (now very few) complain about the lack of ventilation; you may want to consider that when combined with the heat. I\\'ve heard that the exhaust system has trouble, but mine works fine. Leather and the keyless entry system weren\\'t available when I got the car so I can\\'t comment on them (I got the car before it was officially announced). I prefer cloth to leather anyway. I wouldn\\'t want this car in the snow: The suspension is too rough for the inevitable surprise potholes, tires aren\\'t meant for snow, and the seats assume that you\\'re not wearing lots of thick clothing. Rain is much better: water generally beads off the windshield at freeway speed, the windshield wiper controls are easy and understandable, and I barely hydroplaned once with the Eagles (and I was really trying). There is also a definite lack of cup holder/small storage places. The GT has map holders below the speakers in the door, but they\\'re rigid plastic that could fit two cassettes or CD\\'s max. The center console/storage bin/arm rest has *1* cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth \"pouch\" but that\\'s it. No change holders. Quite a let-down from the SHO. And the Probe is definitely not a people-mover car or an econo-box car! Lastly, don\\'t store wet car covers in the back. The foam will soak the water up and the result will *not* smell pleasant :-(.

I can name a number of interstate highways in various parts of the country where 130 would be very optimistic in any car.

But the point made by Wharfie and others still stands: if you\\'re going to do 80 in a mil-spec \\'58 Power Wagon (or a Jeep or a tank transporter or other unwieldy rubber-tired vehicle) anywhere, I\\'d suggest the American interstate. Your safe speed there tends to be limited more by your car and skills, road maintenance, and the swarms of fools around you; the roads were designed for going like the devil. Naturally, neither I nor my employer advocates unsafe or unlawful driving. --Joe \"Just another personal opinion from the People\\'s Republic of Berkeley\"',\n",

I'm selling a 1991 Dodge Stealth R/T and I was contacted by this company called the Markham group based out of Illinois. They said they have 7-10 buyers in my area interested in my car or they wouldn't be talking to me. They talked to me for a good 20 minutes asking everything about my car and said they could sell it no problem. They guaranteed that if they didn't sell my car in 75 days, I would get my money back ($389) and since I charged it, I'm protected by federal law which states that if I'm not satisfied, I would get a refund (which is true). They federal expressed all the paperwork to me which had a contract stating their policy about the 75 days and such. I called up the BBB in Illinois and they do not have a file on them which is good news. So they definitely are a legitimate company but so far, it's been over week and I have gotten nothing.

       " 'X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1.4 PL6] My BBB Autoline arbitration experience is over. The outcome was decidedly mixed. I won the battle but lost the war. The arbitrator found that the car was defective, but decided to offer a repurchase well below market value :(. At the time of the hearing, average retail on my truck in the NADA book was $21,025, but the decision was for $17,665. I wrote a letter to the Council of Better Business Bureaus pointing out the fact that if you have an automobile that does not depreciate rapidly, the manufacturer has no incentive to deal with you. There is no way that the manufacturer can loose because they can turn around and sell the vehicle at a profit if the consumer is awarded a repurchase. The attitude of Chevrolet\\'s representative at the hearing tends to support this point of view; he was totally unprepared and did not seem to take the proceeding very seriously. I decided to take the repurchase, even though I am getting totally screwed on the price. I will not have to deal with continuing repairs or selling a lemon myself, and I have no case for a civil suit based on the Idaho lemon law. I am planning to send a letter to my elected representatives telling them how utterly ridiculous the Idaho lemon law is. The law allows for a \"use deduction\" equal to the IRS mileage allowance. As if Chevrolet were buying my gas and paying for my insurance. Summary of the case: In May 1992 I bought a new 3/4 ton HD Chevrolet pickup. Between May 1992 and December 1992 this vehicle required repair after repair. Systems that required attention included the transmission, heater fan, paint, suspension, and motor. The main problem was the five speed manual transmission. They could not install a non-defective transmission in at least four attempts. So, in summary, it is possible to get a repurchase, but you are going to get screwed on the price, unless you paid too much in the first place, or if your car happens to be a model that depreciates rapidly. jackw@hpdmd48.boi.hp.com',\n",

Depending on how you plan to use your SUV, I might recommend also browsing Trailer Boats and one or more of those Pickup, Shotgun, and 4WD magazines. The car rags mostly seem to consider recently graded pea gravel to be offroading and ten sacks of redwood chips to be a bedload.

The MR2's engine is noisy at the best of times, but not even a nice nose - it's one of those very ugly noises. I do an oil change every 2-3 months, and for about 2 months the engine noise sounds relatively quiet during driving and idling. At around the 3 month mark, after an oil change (I've been tracking this very thoroughly for months now) it starts to get that very disgusting noise, not so much during driving, but more so during idling.

When that light goes on, I just take it to the delaer tell them \"It\\'s that time\" and they work on it for 4 hou and you pay $5 for parts and $100 for labor. (Ahh...what they get for labor) I currently have about 95K on my Sprint and of all the times I took it in for service, I never say on the payment sheet anything about the replacement of the Oxygen sensor. What the heck is an Oxygen sensor? As far an I know of, I have never had that thing replaced in my car and the car is purring like a kitten. Now, I don\\'t have a/c (Mother Nature does that for me :-) ) and that might have something to do with it, but I still never heard of an Oxygen sensor. The only MAJOR service job I have had on my car (besides getting the tires replaced if you want to call that a service job) was getting the Rotor, Distributor and Gasket replaced. And that was all done within the past 2 months. What I do at 30K is have a good tune-up, let them replace what ever they need to, pay the bill (about $125) and go home and don\\'t worry about the car for another 30K. Oh, I just remembered something. If that little sensor light bothers you, in the fuse box right below the turn-signal lever up against the dash, there is a swith on the right side. Flip that switch and the light will go off. I do that so that little light won\\'t annoy me. If you can\\'t find it, look it up in the car manuel.

They have a streak of meanness that runs much deeper and stronger than anything I ever experienced even during the height of the 60's racial struggles.

They will prevail unless the rest of humanity decides that it is in their best interest to stand up against these feral humans, and for individuals to start taking some responsibility for their own protection. In a state in which the individuals turn to the authorities and police for protection, the police and government is soon composed of the very feral humans that they originally sought protection from.

Energy Secretary Hails President\\'s Plan For Alternative Fuel Vehicles To: National Desk, Environment and Energy Reporters Contact: Larry Hart of the U.S. Department of Energy, 202-586-5806 WASHINGTON, April 21 -- Secretary of Energy Hazel R. O\\'Leary today said President Clinton\\'s Executive Order on Alternative Fuels will make the federal government a \"driving force behind efforts to increase the availability of both alternative fuel vehicles and fuel supplies.\" President Clinton signed the order today, which calls for federal purchases of alternative fuel vehicles in numbers over the next three years at least 50 percent higher than those called for in the Energy Policy Act of 1992. President Clinton also announced that Texas Land Commissioner Gary Mauro will head up the Federal Fleet Conversion Task Force to advise O\\'Leary on implementation of the Executive Order. \"I am delighted that I will be working with Gary Mauro to make this happen,\" O\\'Leary said. \"As Land Commissioner, Gary Mauro has helped make Texas a national leader in converting the state fleet to alternative fuels, and has been a tireless proponent of natural gas vehicles in speeches across the country.\" The task force is to issue a report within 90 days recommending a plan and schedule of implementation. \"The Department of Energy and all of us in government must lead by example if the option of alternative fuels is going to become a practical, affordable choice for fleet owners across the country,\" O\\'Leary said. \"Increased use of domestically-produced alternative fuels means reducing pollution while creating jobs. We believe that energy efficiency, protecting the environment, and a healthy economy are complimentary goals.\" O\\'Leary said that plans call for the Department of Energy to coordinate the agencies\\' five-year purchase plans, help with funding for extra purchase or conversion costs, and work with GSA to encourage development of the fuel infrastructure needed to make fleet conversions practical. Under the order, the Department of Energy will also be working with states, local governments and industry to coordinate vehicle purchases and encourage manufacturers and fuel suppliers to make alternative fuel vehicles and alternative fuels more widely available. -30- -- Canada Remote Systems - Toronto, Ontario 416-629-7000/629-7044',\n",

This suggestion isn't as far-fetched as it sounds. Years ago in another time and place, I used to do oil changes in boats powered by automotive engines. In many cases, there was no way to get any sort of a tray under the oil pan because it was boxed in by the bottom of the hull and various floation chambers on each side. And if you *did* get something there, you'd spill all the oil out of it for sure trying to get it back out again. So we used a small pump powered by an electric drill to suck the oil out the dipstick hole. There was a long/thin hose on the inlet side designed to fit down the dipstick tube, and another, thicker/shorter hose on the outlet side that you put into any convenient container.

Thanks. > Two shots at it: (1) Check the tires again - if you can see the wear bars, you're down to problem area (and some tires pass a penny test between the bars - that's no guide at all). Your problem in the wet is call hydroplaning. You may not have enough tread left to channel water out from under the tire - so it goes fishy on you as it lifts off the road. (2) Tires age. In particular, soft tire compounds get harder as you put them thru more heat cycles. Harder compounds don't grip as well as soft ones.

I made three different visits to the dealer where I bought my car, and was never pressured. Saturn also had the best after-sales support, and the fixed pricing made it *very* easy for me to decide exactly what I wanted to buy. Another big selling point was running into my mechanic at the dealer. He's been fixing imports for 20 years...and bought a Saturn, based on what he's seen and heard from his customers. Saturn also has a good extended warranty program; $675 for 6 year/60K miles, fully refunded if you don't use it. That works out to an actual cost of $170 or so, based on the 6 year treasury rates. Using savings account rates it's more like $120. In the first three years it also buys you free rental during any warranty work, without counting against the refund. --mike\",\n",

Jeff claimed that the clutch didn\\'t engage. Matty was quick. While Jeff was still stuttering in embarrassed shock he managed to snatch Jeff\\'s credit card for a quick imprint and signature. Twenty minutes later, when Jeff\\'s color had paled to a flush, Matty presented him with an estimate of $580 for a busted right mirror and a hairline crack in the fairing. That was for fixing the crack and masking the damaged area, not a new fairing. Or he could buy the bike.

More than that. GEICO funded the company that developed LIDAR. When locals showed a reluctance to BUY the units, GEICO started giving them away. I know they've given units to the Florida Highway Patrol, County Sheriff's a and some local governments. The real question is why? This is the hook. GEICO, and other Ins. Co.s can tell which drivers represent risk. This is a determination they can make AFTER YOU receive a speeding ticket from one of GEICO's LIDAR units. Most drivers do not represent increased risk even after a ticket or two, but this gives them the opportunity to RAISE RATES FOR EQUAL RISK. It's called extra profits. They also know how silly the NSL is, and how it is almost universally ignored. Driving in excess of the NSL gets you a ticket, an increase in your rates, points on your license --- but it doesn't make you a riskier driver to insure. Like the sound of this? Like the people who thought up the scheme? Go GEICO! Unless you have some driving history problems, you're usually better to go with one of the major companies and stay there. You'll get long term customer discounts on your premiums. Now, about the % of your premium that is paid as commission. That's another story for another day.\",\n",

My previous car had locking lugnuts that weighed about 2.5oz. more than the others. The locking lugnuts were factory equipment, and according to the factory service manual, after tire balancing the technician/mechanic was supposed to put a 1/2 oz. counterweight on the rim opposite the locking nut. I always had vibration problems with those stupid lugnuts since no one ever did the service correctly. I eventually got rid of the locking lugnuts and replaced them with the standard lugnuts. Unfortunately, I found out about the counterweighting technique 6 months after I got rid of the locking nuts. :-( My present car, a Saturn SC, has locking lugnuts that I bought at the dealer and are made specifically for the Saturn. They have been made to be exactly the same weight as the non-locking lugnuts (said so on the package and I verified it myself). I haven't had any vibration problems with the tires at all (due to the nuts) in 12,000 of ownership. I did have some other vibration problems, but it was due to a poor job of tire balancing.

Diesels fall into the same emissions mythology as alcohol fuels. The main reason they are considered \"cleaner\" is because they are better at the emissions we actually measure and regulate. But they also contribute additional emissions which have long been determined to be as harmful, but no suitable control or limits have been defined. Current evidence is pointing to most visible smog actually being diesel emissions and suspended particles and less of a photo-chemical reaction. Diesel particulates are now becoming a major concern in decreased lung capacity. And alcohols emit signifcantly more aldehydes (a known carcinigen) than gasoline. The evidence is mounting that while we have been beating the gasoline engine to death, we may have been ignoring the effects of the alternatives. And anyone who thinks diesels are so great, should go and spend a few hours in rush hour traffic in some cities in Europe. There the stench of the diesels is awful and it can even burn the eyes. Diesels being clean is only relative to our current standards. Mark',\n",

This is where I came in. Obcountersteer: For some reason, I\\'ve discovered that pulling on the wrong side of the handlebars (rather than pushing on the other wrong side, if you get my meaning) provides a feeling of greater control. For example, rather than pushing on the right side to lean right to turn right (Hi, Lonny!), pulling on the left side at least until I get leaned over to the right feels more secure and less counter-intuitive.

What you described SOUNDS the same to me. In fact, what little & i\\'ve studied on trannies, the instructor referred to the synchros as \"dogs\" & and said they were synonymous. The gears are always meshed in a synchronized & gearbox, and you slip the synchro gears back and forth by shifting. Or at least, & that is what i was taught. Explain, por favour? Motorcycle transmissions don\\'t have synchros. The engagment dogs are very corse and sloppy. There are maybe 6-10 teeth (dogs) on the side of the gears that engage the next gear over as the forks slide the gears back and forth. To shift: start to apply pressure at the same time the clutch is pulled (the clutch is a hand lever) and shift quickly. If you try a slow lazy shift it will grind, you just have to pop it into the next gear before it has a chance to grind. There isn\\'t a neutral between gears (obviously there is, but you can\\'t select it with the shifter) so double clutching is not a possibility. \"speed shifting\" (which is what I have always heard \"clutchless shifting\" called) works pretty well for upshifts with some practice, but I usually use the clutch-especially for the lower gears. I think auto (as in automobile) trannys are similar, except that the engagment dogs are very fine, with no slop. And the addition of syncho rings. The gear teeth are always engaged in auto transmissions that are synchronized, but may not be in non-synchro gears (reverse and sometimes first). -- Frank Ball 1UR-M frankb@sad.hp.com (707) 794-4168 work, Hewlett Packard (707) 794-3844 fax, (707) 538-3693 home 1212 Valley House Drive IT175, XT350, Seca 750, \\'62 F-100, PL510 Rohnert Park CA 94928-4999 KC6WUG, LAW, AMA, Dod #7566, I\\'m the NRA.',\n",

Or should I just work with \"If I drink tonight, I >don\\'t ride until tomorrow\"? This thread brings back memorys of an expensive day in traffic court a few years ago. While I was waiting my turn to state my case and plea of why I was going 75 in a 55 in my cage, I had the opportunity to listen to some of the \"creative excuses\" offered the judge by others. After listening to a number of \"Well, I was passing a very slow truck that suddenly speed up\" versions, I decided that the judge had heard just about every story in the book and then some. He was less than impressed with any of them. This young, rather burley looking guy, had his docket read by a rather drill sargent looking Ohio State Highyway Patrol Trooper. He was clocked riding a motorcycle at a speed of 110 mph in a 55 mph zone. It was also noted that the defendant (motorcycle rider) had alcohol on his breath, but was not cited for this offence. The judge looked over his half glasses purched on the end of his nose and said in his sternest voice: \"Well son, those are some pretty fast speeds to be riding a motorcycle. What do you have to say for your self?\" \"Well Sir\", meekly the defenant replied, \"I just was over to my buddys and we had a couple of beers and I was on my way home.\" He offered nothing more or less. Just had a couple of beers and was doing 110 mph on his way home. The judge moved by the simplicity of the response, fined him the maximum in this case (plus court costs of course) and ordered him to attend remedial drivers training school.

Ouch. :-) This brings to mind one of the recommendations in the Hurt Study. Because the rear of the gas tank is in close proximity to highly prized and easily damaged anatomy, Hurt et al recommended that manufacturers build the tank so as to reduce the, er, step function provided when the rider's body slides off of the seat and onto the gas tank in the unfortunate event that the bike stops suddenly and the rider doesn't. I think it's really inspiring how the manufacturers have taken this advice to heart in their design of bikes like the CBR900RR and the GTS1000A.

Personally, I\\'ve never won that way or seen anyone win, but the judge always listens politely. And I haven\\'t seen _that_ many attempts. You could try the argument that since bikes are shorter than the cars whose speed the nice officer is accustomed to guessing, they therefore appear to be further away, and so their speed appears to be greater than it actually is. I left out a step or two, but you get the idea. If you can make it convincing, theoretically you\\'re supposed to win. I\\'ve never tried proving the cop was mistaken. I did get to see some other poor biker try it. He was mixing up various facts like the maximum acceleration of a (cop) car, and the distance at which the cop had been pacing him, and end up demonstrating that he couldn\\'t possibly have been going as fast as the cop had suggested. He\\'d brought diagrams and a calculator. He was Prepared. He lost. Keep in mind cops do this all the time, and their word is better than yours. Maybe, though, they don\\'t guess how fast bikes are going all the time. Besides, this guy didn\\'t speak English very well, and ended up absolutely confounding the judge, the cop, and everyone else in the room who\\'d been recently criminalized by some twit with a gun and a quota. Ahem. OK, I\\'m better now. Maybe he\\'d have won had his presentation been more polished. Maybe not. He did get applause.',\n",

A farmer that lives near by used to have to overhaul his big deisel tractors at least every other year if not every year. Since he has been using S-50 he has went 5 years without an overhaul. Also a friend at a machine shop has in the past rebuilt engines with 200K miles on them because the coustomer thought it was time. These coustomers had ran S-50 since almost new. It was found when measuring the internals of the engine that they showed only about the amount of wear that would be expected of 30K miles not 200K.

Oh, that's not so bad. Every time I try to change the oil, I forget to shut off the engine first. The hot oil comes out and scalds me, blinds me, then the engine starts to overheat, and while I'm screaming in agony and trying to crawl out from under the car, I grab the red hot exhaust pipe and get third degree burns on my hands. My screams intensify as I finally emerge from under the car, and I struggle to my feet in front of the car, whereupon the radiator hose ruptures and sprays me with super heated coolant.

Mazda 626 + very comfortable and roomy + can theoretically get ABS on DX model, though in practice this is hard to find + base price for base model includes numerous little things like: tach, variable speed wipers, rear defroster, 60/40 split folding rear seat - more expensive than many other cars listed below Honda Civic + DX gets significantly better mileage than other cars listed here + comfortable front seat + adjustable seat belt mounting - no ABS without EX model (includes $1000\\'s of other things like a sunroof) Geo Prizm/Toyota Corolla - seats not very comfortable to us (your mileage may vary) + adjustable seat belt mounting + can get ABS without lots of other extras Saturn + SL2 was quite comfortable, though SL1 less so - motorized attack belts Dodge Spirit no real outstanding +\\'s, but seemed generally ok - rear seat does not fold down Chevy Corsica + comes with ABS standard - lower \"would you buy that car again\" and safety ratings in Consumer Reports (than first 3 cars above) - suspension didn\\'t feel as stiff as the others (this would be a + for some) The Honda Accord and Toyota Camry were both more expensive than the 626, and in our minds, not significantly better. We probably gave disproportionately low consideration to the \"big 3\", due (a) to my wife\\'s family\\'s general dislike of Chrysler products, (b) some unimpressive GM products owned by my parents and a housemate of mine (c) the Taurus comes with automatic transmission, I find the seat of the Tempo very uncomfortable, and the escort has attack belts and no air bag. We\\'ll probably end up with a 626 - I saw a 626 DX with A/C and cassette advertised for just under $12800 (Washington Post, April 14, I think), and my local dealer says they can match that price. I will probably get the 626 (maybe tomorrow). The main question in my mind is whether or not I will have to do a \"factory order\" or \"preference order\" to get one with ABS, and whether or not the dealership will run the price up a lot if I do so.',\n",

Think the '86 GL1200I originally sold for $6500 brand new, not sure. If that's the case then it depreciated 30.77% over 7 years or a mere $2000. Big Fat Hairy Deal! Based on what I know, Harleys tend to depreciate your monies far more than the initial depreciation of the bike itself when it comes to parts and service. All this about Harleys holding their value better doesn't always wash away the knocks on them...such as being much slower. ;-) According to Peter Egan in the just released Cycle World his FLHS is a real dog when he pillions his 120lb wife.

You raise a valid point, but again it's a tradeoff -- how much money do you want to spend for that kind of protection? You could buy a Volvo, Saab, or 'Benz and get really good crash protection (and other luxuries) but you'll pay significantly more for it. In my case it's out of the question because *all* of those cars are beyond my budget. Even in high-speed head-on collisions the most beneficial item you can have is a good old 3-point seatbelt.

       " 'After a tip from Gary Crum (crum@fcom.cc.utah.edu) I got on the Phone with \"Pontiac Systems\" or \"Pontaic Customer Service\" or whatever, and inquired about a rumoured Production Hold on the Formula Firebird and Trans Am. BTW, Talking with the dealer I bought the car from got me nowhere. After being routed to a \"Firebird Specialist\", I was able to confirm that this is in fact the case. At first, there was some problem with the 3:23 performance axle ratio. She wouldn\\'t go into any details, so I don\\'t know if there were some shipped that had problems, or if production was held up because they simply didn\\'t have the proper parts from the supplier. As I say, she was pretty vague on that, so if anyone else knows anything about this, feel free to respond. Supposedly, this problem is now solved. Second, there is a definate shortage of parts that is somehow related to the six-speed Manual transmission. So as of this posting, there is a production hold on these cars. She claimed part of the delay was not wanting to use inferior quality parts for the car, and therefore having to wait for the right high quality parts... I\\'m not positive that this applies to the Camaro as well, but I\\'m guessing it would. Can anyone else shed some light on this?

There is no drain holes that I know of. I used a margine tub to drain it Regretably I waited three months as I was short cash and they wouldn\\'t fix it under warrantee.

So I ended up paying about $200 to have the sensor replaced; $90 to have the tail lights resealed (they firts replaced the hatch gasket which I insisted was not the problem so they did not charge me for that when I proved to be right.); not to mention the water damage to the covers to the trunk/spare com partment and algae in the taillights. very annoying.

I have no idea how either of my Hondas will handle at 100+ mph, nor do they reach 155. However, using `high\\' to be 70-90 mph: a) They are quite amenable to long high speed drives. I\\'ve done several 1k mile+ trips in my Civic with no problems whatsoever. The last big trip I made was driving from New York to Texas. I remember driving 700-800 miles a day at typically 75-85 mph without any problems. I\\'m sure I would have been more comfortable driving a benz, but no white knuckles. No problems with winds and curves. Then there was the trip back from New Orleans after Mardi Gras - where we were doing 80+ all the way to Houston. No problems. b) Both my cars have surprising good fuel economy at high speeds. I see no difference between sustained 60 mph and sustained 80mph. On the trip back from New Orleans, we got about 30 mpg in my Integra, quite ok. Mind you, the engine revs to almost 4k at 80. The civic is markedly better than the Integra in fuel economy. 50k miles down the road, I still get 35 mpg at 70-75 mph driving. >|> b) I can\\'t understand why these high-scale European marquees are afraid >|> to design engines that can be repeatedly revved to near redline in >|> the low gears.

No cracks in the heads or pistons, the cylinder walls look very clean, and the wear of pistons and cylinders is not measurable. All still within factory specs.

This is a very good dirt bike and has been maintained perfectly. I never had any problems with it. It's a four stroke, 4 valves, liquid cooled engine. It is heavier than a 250 2 stroke but still lighter than a Honda XR600 and has a lot better suspension (Ohlins shock, Husky fork) than the XR. For the casual or non competitive rider, the engine is much better than any two stroke. You can easily lug up hills and blast through trails with minimum gear changes. The 1992 ignition and the carefully tuned carburation makes this bike very easy to start (starts of first kick when cold or hot). There is a custom made carbon/kevlar (light 1 pound) wrap around skid plate to protect the engine cases and the water pump. The steering angle has been reduced by 2 degree to increase steering quickness. This with the suspension tune-up by Phil Douglas of Aftershock (Multiple time ISDE rider) gives it a better ride than most bike: plush suspension, responsive steering with no head shake. So if it is such a good bike why sell it???? Gee, I want to buy a Husaberg, which just a husky but 25 pounds lighter... and a tad more $$$.\",\n",

This is a tricky situation; if the previous owner didn\\'t inform the dealer of the odometer change, then the previous owner committed fraud, and he may be liable. The dealer may also be liable; If the previous owner notified the dealer, or if the previous owner had the dash replaced at a dealer, or if the previous owner had the dash changed legally, any records search on the car should turn up the fact that the odometer had been altered. If a dealer changes the speedometer, he has to report it (it goes into the car\\'s service record with the manufacturer, and on the title, if I remember correctly; the dealer told me that the old mileage, etc. were sent to Ford when my T-Bird\\'s speedo was replaced). If the odometer can be set to the old mileage, it must be; if it can\\'t (eg, electrically-driven odometers) then the mileage of the old odometer must be written on a permanent sticker which is affixed to the door frame of the vehicle. Either way, if the change had been done legally, then a records search (which the dealer almost certainly did) should have turned it up.

Sometimes a bad choke pull-off diaphram will cause a car to fast idle. The pull-off, which is vacuum actuated, provides a necessary pull in non-cold weather conditions to get the idle off the the fast idle cam. Locate the fast idle cam on your vehicle and see if you can rotate it to produce a normal idle. If so, locate the diaphram and test it. If you can't apply suction (via a good piece of rubber vacuum hose) with your mouth that will cause the diaphram to retract, then it's bad and should be replaced.

I've got an 89 GT. It has the smoked taillight assembly. I think this is where the water is getting in. When I first got it (had it for a month), one of the rear taillights fogged up with moisture. I took it in to the dealer and they replaced the entire assembly. It happened to the other one about 3 months later. This time I happened to look in the spare tire well and noticed water standing in there. The dealer was more reluctant this time to replace it. But I convinced them to fix it. (They must have had to deal with a number of other probes with the same problem.) I haven't noticed water in the taillamps (or the trunk) for the last 2.5 years, but just last month, the taillamp just fogged up again. I'm going to try to take it back to get them to fix it again. I'm real tempted to drill some vent and drain holes in the tops and bottoms of the assembly and forget about it. This is getting very annoying.

Rich, First of all you might want to join the VetteNet (vettes@chiller.compaq .com) during your search/acquisition of the 67. $20k sounds about right for a wrong engine, condition 3 car. This means that the car may not have significant investment value but could be an excellent driver and or hobby car. You will also want to get a copy of the Corvette Black Book immediately. Don\\'t leave home (to look at Vettes) without it. Since you are contemplating spending >$20k, you might want to invest a few hours in reading the \"Corvette Buyer\\'s Guide\" and purchase Noland Adams\\' tape \"How to Buy a Corvette.\" The tape shows you how to check for damage, etc.. There are many many factors that will affect the value, road worthiness, and repair expense of your proposed 67. The list is much too long to go into here. Join the VetteNet where there are over 100 current Corvette owners (many with 60s vintage vettes) that are available to help you.

In many of our cities, there are traffic signals every 100 feet (unsynchronised, of course (well here in Ottawa anyway)) and the roads are so congested that shifting manually is a real pain in the left foot.

An On/Off Road Rally consists of the following: 1. An on-the-road rally where participants are given a set of directions and clues guiding participates around the Joliet/Plainfield area. The object is to navigate a course based on a set of directions and clues. Participants will be given a set of questions pertaining to the course which they must answer along the way. Points are awarded for the number of correct answers given. Directions will ultimately lead to an off-road area where a four-wheel drive course is set-up. At various locations in the on-road course, check-points will be set-up where participants will be asked other questions or requested to perform some activity (e.g. tire roll, truck tow, basketball free-throw, etc.) for additional points. 2. An optional off-road, four wheel drive course where participants will navigate off-road trails, mud bogs and/or hill climbs. Points are awarded for successfully navigating off-road obstacles without getting stuck. If you should get stuck (which is half the fun anyway), there will be assistance to get your vehicle unstuck so you can try it again. The off-road course will divided up based on tire size, so stock 4x4s as well as modified 4x4s can run the course. At the end of the rally, trophies will be awarded to top scoring participants. Door prizes and dash plaques will also be given out. Food and drinks also available at the conclusion. * This is an organized activity sponsored by the Joliet Mud Turtles so safety and fun is our foremost concern. All 4x4s must be street legal and have solid tow points for the off-road section of the course - we don\\'t want to have to separate someone\\'s bumper from their vehicle :) . The Particulars: * Rally begins at Instant Replay, 2409 Plainfield Road, Joliet Il. (815)436-9382 (see map below) * Registration is between 9 and 10:30 a.m. First truck out at 10:00 a.m. * Rally date is Sunday April 25th, rain or shine * There is an entry fee of $10 per truck. * You must have a co-driver (passengers allowed) * A valid drivers license is required * Suggested equipment: CB Radio Compass Tow Strap and Clevis Clip Board and Pencil * No alcohol during rally * For more information contact Gary (815)727-3415 Tom (815)485-9346 Norm Jr. (815)741-4853 Brian (708)979-6083 __ Instant /\\\\ | Replay | | \\\\ | 1.9mi ___ | 1.2 mi | North |<----->| | <------------> | Rt30 | |___| | | ------|--------------------------------------------- Exit | | | ^ 257 | | | | | | | | |Rt55 |Canton |Larkin | | |Farm |Ave | | |Rd. | | 3 mi. | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Rt80 | v ---------------------------------------------------- | | Exit | | 130B | |',\n",

Some where harder than others to shift but generally the higher the milage the smoother quicker & easier they where to shift. My technique is to ease back off the throttle and at the same time gently wrist back on the shift lever. If for some reason I miss the shift window, I lightly press the accelerator & try agian.

You know, I\\'m a Ford fan, I must say, so I\\'m looking forward to the next Mustang. I have faith that it will be a fine product, more desireable than the Camaro is now. You know, that\\'s MHO. The differences these days between Ford and GM are not so much the quality, just the philosophy. It used to be quality _and_ philosophy. GM is barely catching up, but they have more room for improvement that can only be made up in time. STSs still come off the assembly line with screwed up paint stripes and poor trunk/door/hood/panel alignments; it\\'s those 75 year old plants. And the latest GM products still come with the standard equipment RattleDash (tm). But like I said, they\\'re getting better and making the move in the right direction. They beat Ford to the market with the Camaro/Firebird, but really only in words. Production of these vehicles will be limited until the end of the year, keeping selling prices above MSRP for the most part since there are so many twitching Camaro fans out there. I wouldn\\'t press Ford to hurry the Mustang since the final wait could be worth it. Besides, no bow-tie fanatic is gonna buy the Mustang anyway. I do not put much stock in the mag rags\\' \"inside\" information, or even Ford rep quotes. The Taurus was pretty much a surprise when it was finally disclosed in it\\'s entirety. \"Inside\" information had the Taurus with a V8 and rear-wheel drive at one point. I wouldn\\'t look for a simple re-paneled Mustang, folks; you may be cheating yourself if you do. There\\'s a lot of potential. Ford hasn\\'t released a new car without a 4-wheel IS in 7 years. The Mustang project has been brewing for at least 4, right? A 4-wheel IS could happen. Those modular V8\\'s are out there, too. In the interest of CAFE and competition, don\\'t rule those out, either. Your ignorant if you do. And there are so many spy shots and artist renderings out there, who really knows what it\\'ll look like? The Mach III? Doubt it. Highly. The next Mustang will be Ford\\'s highest profile car. It attracts way more attention than the Camaro/Firebird because it\\'s heritage is more embedded in the general public. Don\\'t lie to yourself and believe Ford will forfeit that. I submit that the Mustang will be a success. Enough to elicit defensive remarks from some heavy Camaro fans here. You know, intelligent, critical spews like, \"The Mustang bites, man!\" Some of you are already beginning. I predict that the Mustang and Camaro will be comparable performers, as usual. I predict that the differences will be in subjective areas like looks and feel, as usual. The Camaro is still a huge automobile; the Mustang will retain its cab-rearward styling and short, pony-car wheelbase. The Camaro still reaches out to the fighter pilot, while the Mustang will appeal to the driver. The Camaro will still sell to the muscle car set, while the Mustang will continue to sell to the college-degreed muscle car set. Both will be more refined (I do think the Camaro is). There will be no clear winner. Unless the Ford gets the 32v, 300hp Romeo.

Before I delve into its innards, I thought I\\'d check \"net.wisdom\" on the subject. :) It\\'s a 1985 Buick Skyhawk (I know...I know) 2.0l EFI 4-banger auto 35k miles When I drive tha car long enough to get it hot (especially at highways speeds) the transmission has this nasty habit of getting \"stuck\" in 3rd gear. As a result, when you stop for a light the motor stalls. Putting the car in park, and waiting for 30-60 seconds before restarting sometimes allows the transmission to \"reset\" and go back into 1st. Otherwise, it just stalls when put in drive. My thoughts: Either it the 3rd gear band is binding and getting stuck when it gets hot (not so likely) or perhaps the lock-up converter is not disengaging properly (seems likely). The least likely (keeping fingers crossed) is that some critical vacuum hose has broken/cracked and this behaviour is due to lack of vaccuum somewhere (as used to happen with old modulator valves). My background is that my father owns a service station and I worked there on and off from 10-19 years of age.

The technology Cummins is applying to diesels to comply with the newer Ca. emissions laws involves three things I know of: 1. All compliant diesels are turbocharged. 2. All use an \"aftercooler\", which cools the air which was heated by compression by the turbocharger (up to about 25 PSI). 3. A gismo on the injector pump which senses the pressurized air intake, and limits full delivery of fuel while the pressure is low. No scrubbers, catalytic converters, etc, are used. The path from the turbocharger to the exhaust outlet is kept very free. Interestingly, except for the low-pressure fuel limitation, power output and mileage are enhanced by these measures. One can buy aftermarket turbos and aftercoolers which generate more power, lots more power, and these are approved by the CARB. Dan Hepner',\n",

Not alone at all. My old 83 Accord (now in the hands of a sibling) has a much better engagement of the clutch. Even the old 84 Civic we keep as a beater feels better in this aspect. Note that these are cars with 250,000 kms and 140,000 kms respectively. My 90 Prelude blows both of them away in every respect except smooth clutch engagement. Of course the Kawasaki is the best of the bunch but I need more than 2 wheels most of the time. The Prelude has had a dud clutch from day 1, and after three years and 67,000 kms is no better.

Indeed.) the flat four is also shorter than an inline 4, so even if it is mounted longitudinally it will not take up lots of length.. and a longitudinal placement is easier for a 4 wheel drive drivetrain. i think that subaru's ads hold water. in practice, their flat fours are noticeably smoother than inline 4s and completely buzz free, though some may not like its peculiar note. but as alfa has shown, a boxer four can produce a spine tingling scream that only the likes of recent hondas can approach. eliot\",\n",

Don\\'t lie to yourself and >believe Ford will forfeit that. The car magazines have printed a lot of information about the new Mustang and the consensus about what to believe in my \"car circle\" is that the suspension pieces and tuning will be almost identical to the current Cobra, but on a stiffer body structure which will improve its behavior. After the MN12 (Thunderbird) cost and weight debacle, Ford decided independent rear suspension with rear wheel drive won\\'t be tried again in a volume car. The current 4.9l V-8 will soldier on for about two years. A version of the 32 valve modular V-8 in the Mark VIII could be offered then. Ford is spending big money tooling up for 2.5l and 3.5l V-6 engines which will power most of their cars in the immediate future, and therefore probably do not consider volume production of 300 hp V-8 engines a priority. Undisguised, the car looks OK, but not nearly as exciting as the new Camaro/Firebird, IMO. I suspect Ford will produce their car with higher quality than GM will achieve with the Camaro/ Firebird. The way GM loses money, the temptation to \"just get them out the door\" for the sake of positive cash flow will be great once demand really takes off. Tim Gardner',\n",

This must vary from state to state, because our old company Kemper wanted to drop me (keeping my wife) or tripple our premium because i had 1 ticket. Only 2 points for 10 mph over speed limit. Well i called Geico, and they insured both my wife and i for less then we were previously paying Kemper. Generally i hate the whole insurance game.
